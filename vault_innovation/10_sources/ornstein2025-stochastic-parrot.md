How to Train Your Stochastic Parrot:
Large Language Models for Political Texts∗

July 23, 2024
Abstract
Large language models pretrained on massive corpora of text from the Internet have trans-
formed the way that computer scientists approach natural language processing over the past
five years. But such models have yet to see widespread adoption in the social sciences, partly
due to their novelty and upfront costs. In this paper, we demonstrate how few-shot prompts
to large language models can be effectively applied to a wide range of text-as-data tasks in
political science—including sentiment analysis, document scaling, and topic modeling. In a series
of pre-registered analyses, this approach outperforms conventional supervised learning methods
without the need for extensive data pre-processing or large sets of labeled training data. And
performance is comparable to expert and crowd-coding methods at a fraction of the cost. We
propose a set of best practices for adapting these models to social science measurement tasks,
and develop an open-source software package for researchers.

1 Introduction
A common task in political science research involves labeling documents to capture some latent
quantity of interest. Whether it’s measuring the ideology expressed in party manifestos (Lowe
et al., 2011), the harshness of treaty provisions (Spirling, 2012), polarization in legislative speeches
(Peterson and Spirling, 2018), partisan slant in television news coverage (Martin and McCrain, 2019),
political sophistication in State of the Union addresses (Benoit, Munger and Spirling, 2019), opinions
expressed in city council meeting minutes (Einstein, Glick and Palmer, 2019), or countless other
examples, so much of modern political science would be impossible without quantitative measures
derived from unstructured text. Until quite recently, however, the process of reading and coding
documents has been a task uniquely suited to human researchers. One of the most exciting new
developments in our field has been the explosion of methods for automating this process, methods
we broadly call “text as data” (Grimmer and Stewart, 2013).
These efforts in political science have occurred alongside a parallel revolution in computer science,
developing natural language processing tools to usefully interpret human speech. The applications
for these methods are numerous—including chat bots, Internet search, auto-complete, and virtual
assistants—but remarkably, much of this research has begun to converge on a single solution: large,
pretrained language models built on a neural network architecture called the transformer (Vaswani
et al., 2017; Bommasani et al., 2021). Such models have quickly transitioned from academic curiosity
to cultural phenomenon following the release of OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020).
In this paper, we demonstrate that adapting these large language models (LLMs) to political
text-as-data tasks can yield significant gains in performance, cost, and capabilities. Across a
range of applications—including sentiment classification, ideology scaling, and topic modeling—we
show that carefully structured prompts to large language models (“few-shot prompting”) reliably
outperforms existing automated text classification methods, and produces results comparable to
human crowd-coders at a small fraction of the cost.
LLMs are deep learning models (LeCun, Bengio and Hinton, 2015) trained on “next word” prediction
tasks. When provided with a sequence of text, the model generates a probability distribution over
2


<!-- page 3 -->

the most likely words to follow that sequence.1For example, when prompted with the phrase
“Thank you. Have a nice”, GPT-3 estimates that there is an 88.6% probability the next word will be
“day”, a 2.4% probability the next word will be “weekend”, a 1.9% probability it will be “evening”
and so on.
Though these models are essentially “stochastic parrots” mimicking human speech patterns observed
in their training corpus (Bender et al., 2021), they have demonstrated a number of surprising
emergent capabilities that they were not deliberately designed to do. By carefully crafting its input,
one canadapta language model to perform a variety of text-as-data tasks. Consider the following
prompt, which reformulates a sentiment classification task as a next word prediction problem:
Decide whether a Tweet 's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.
Tweet: Congratulations to the SCOTUS. American confidence in the Supreme
Court is now lower than at any time in history. Well done!
Sentiment:
Conventional approaches to sentiment classification struggle to accurately label texts like these,
which use positive words to convey a negative sentiment (e.g. “congratulations”, “confidence”,
“supreme”, “well done!”). But when supplied with this prompt, GPT-3 estimates a 77% probability
that the next word will be “Negative”. GPT-4’s estimate is even more confident, returning “Negative”
with 99% probability. In what follows, we show that such probability distributions can be used to
construct continuous measures for a variety of latent document characteristics, and across several
applications we validate this approach by converting several common political text-as-data tasks
into next word prediction problems.
This approach to modeling is fundamentally different than the one familiar to most political scientists.
Rather than fitting a separate model for each research question (“one-to-one”), the researcher takes
a single pretrained language model and adapts it to several different tasks (“one-to-many”). The
promise of this approach lies in the scale and complexity that a single pretrained LLM can offer.
GPT-3 is a deep neural network composed of 175 billion parameters, trained on hundreds of billions
of words of text from the Internet and digitized books (Brown et al., 2020). Although less is publicly
known about the architecture of GPT-3’s successor, GPT-4, it is rumored to have roughly 1.7 trillion
1Technically, LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 represent text as “tokens”, strings of roughly four characters, rather
than words, but for illustrative purposes we can think of it as operating at the word-level.

parameters and cost over $100 million to build. Because such models are orders-of-magnitude more
complex than an individual political scientist could train, there is ample reason to believe that, for
certain tasks, LLMs can outperform “bespoke” models trained for a specific purpose. Furthermore,
the approach does not require the researcher to construct a large labeled dataset to train the model.
One can adapt pretrained LLMs to many document labeling tasks by including just a handful of
labeled examples in the body of the prompt, an approach known as few-shot prompting (Brown
et al., 2020).
The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we describe the basic architecture of these
models, and how they make use of innovations like self-supervised learning and contextualized word
embeddings to generate predictions. In section three, we describe four applications of the models to
common political text-as-data tasks, including sentiment analysis of social media posts, classifying
the tone of political advertisements, ideology scaling on party manifestos, and topic modeling of
US Congressional floor speeches. Based on lessons learned from these applications, we propose a
set of best practices for prompt design and develop an open-source software package to implement
our suggested approach.2We conclude with a discussion on whether the performance gains we
document are worth the potential dangers associated with unprincipled use of these models (Abid,
Farooqi and Zou, 2021; Bender et al., 2021; Strubell, Ganesh and McCallum, 2019; Spirling, 2023).
Throughout, we emphasize the importance of “validation, validation, validation” (Grimmer and
Stewart, 2013), repeatedly comparing model outputs against human judgment to ensure they are
measuring what we want them to measure.
2 Large Language Models
In this section, we highlight two key features of large language models that make them particularly
promising for social science applications. The first is self-supervised learning , which permits these
models to be trained on an unprecedentedly large corpus of text data. The second is contextualized
word embeddings , which allow the models to flexibly represent the meaning of words depending on
their context.

2.1 Self-supervision
A central difficulty for supervised learning methods in text analysis is the need to collect and
annotate large amounts of training data (Wilkerson and Casas, 2017). If, for example, a researcher
wants to train a model to predict the tone of political advertisements, they must first compile a
dataset with thousands of labeled political ads. The process of hand-labeling these data can be
expensive and time-consuming, even with the help of non-expert crowd-sourced approaches (Benoit
et al., 2016; Carlson and Montgomery, 2017).
By contrast, a self-supervised learning task is one in which the target prediction is provided within
the data itself, rather than hand-labeled by a researcher. One reason why LLMs like GPT-3 and
GPT-4 are trained to perform next word prediction is that such training can be completed in a
self-supervised fashion. Every sentence of text that a human has ever written can be split into a
sequence of tokens and used to train the model, which permits a massive expansion in the amount
of training data available. Rather than training a supervised learning model just on a few thousand
documents, LLMs are trained on hundreds of billions of words scraped from the Internet and a
digitized corpus of books.
When combined with rapid improvements in computer hardware, this dramatic increase in the
quantity of training data has allowed computer scientists to build increasingly complex language
models over the past five years. Bommasani et al. (2021) coin the term “foundation models” to
describe this new class of general-purpose language models, because they can be adapted to perform
a variety of natural language processing tasks that they were not explicitly trained to do.
2.2 Contextualized Word Embeddings
In order to analyze “text as data”, one must first decide how to represent a text numerically.
Conventional “bag of words” approaches (Grimmer, Roberts and Stewart, 2022) represent each
documentasavectorofwordfrequencies. Themaindrawbackofthisrepresentationisthatitassumes
each word has a unique meaning. Mathematically, the document-feature matrix is extremely sparse;
there are hundreds of thousands of unique words, but many of them have overlapping meaning.
To overcome this problem, large language models like GPT-3 represent each word in a document as
5


<!-- page 6 -->

a high-dimensional vector, an approach known as “word embeddings”. This representation attempts
to retain information about the meaning of words by encoding how often a word is used in the
vicinity of other related words—motivated by John Firth’s linguistic maxim, “you shall know a word
by the company it keeps” (Firth, 1957; Rodriguez and Spirling, 2021). For example, in a sufficiently
large corpus of text, you will discover that the word “cat” appears more frequently than you would
expect by chance near words like “litter”, “yarn”, “claws”, etc. You’d also find that the word “kitten”
appears more frequently than you would expect by chance near those words. A word embedding,
incorporating this information, represents “cat” and “kitten” with vectors that are close together in
space. By training word embeddings on a large corpus of texts, one can transfer knowledge about
the meaning of words from a more general corpus to a specific text-as-data problem.
But this approach to representing meaning can still fall short, because there are many words whose
meaning is ambiguous without context. Consider, for instance, the word “bill”, which could have
one of several meanings, depending on whether it is preceded by the phrase “signed the...”, “foot
the...”, or “Hillary and...”. Other common words, like the pronouns “it” or “they”, are entirely
meaningless without context. For such words, a single pretrained word embedding is unlikely to
capture meaning very well.
When humans are interpreting words in a sentence, we start with our “pretrained” idea of what a
word means, then adjust that interpretation on the fly as we read the word in context (like you just
did with the word “fly”). This is the insight behind contextualized word embeddings , which allow a
word’s vector representation to change depending on what words precede or follow it. Large language
models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 are built on a neural network architecture called the transformer
(Vaswani et al., 2017). The transformer model takes as its input a sequence of word embeddings,
and outputs an embedding vector representing the most likely next word in the sequence. The
key innovation of these models is the inclusion of many hidden layers of “self-attention”, which
recompute each word’s embedding as a weighted average of nearby word embeddings in the sequence.
This allows the model to flexibly represent the meaning of words based on their context.
Buildingonthetransformerarchitecture, therehasbeenrapidprogressinnaturallanguageprocessing
over the past ten years. In 2016, the best-performing language model scored an F (59.3%) on
the 8th grade New York Regents Science Exam. By 2019, a large language model based on the
6


<!-- page 7 -->

transformer architecture scored 91.6% (Clark et al., 2021). By 2023, models like OpenAI’s GPT-4
were outscoring 90% of human test takers on exams as challenging as the SAT and Uniform Bar
Examination (Katz et al., 2023). For political scientists, the practical advantage of adapting these
models is that, by better representing the nuance and ambiguity of political speech, they can
outperform existing “bag of words” methods at classifying, measuring, and discovering patterns in
political texts. We turn next to a few examples of this approach in practice.
3 Applications
We assess the performance of LLM prompts on a set of common political science text-as-data tasks,
including sentiment analysis, ideology scaling, and topic modeling. These applications demonstrate
the range of tasks that a single pretrained language model is capable of performing. In our first
application, we classify the sentiment of a novel set of social media posts related to US Supreme
Court rulings, comparing classifications from GPT-3 and GPT-4 against other automated methods
for sentiment analysis. We demonstrate that the LLMs produce superior measures of sentiment,
particularly for texts whose meaning is ambiguous without understanding the political context in
which they were written. Next, we classify the tone of American political ads from Carlson and
Montgomery (2017), comparing the performance of LLM classifications against crowds of human
coders. Our third application replicates the ideology scaling of political manifestos conducted by
Benoit et al. (2016) via crowd-coding. And for our final application we assign topic labels to 9,704
one-minute floor speeches from the US House of Representatives (Wilkerson and Casas, 2017),
demonstrating that LLMs can serve as a useful tool for discovery as well as classification. These
four applications provide a varied set of tasks and contexts with which to evaluate the performance
of this approach.
For each application, we pre-registered an analysis plan for how we would adapt the LLMs to
document classification and scaling tasks.3We took this step to ensure that we do not overstate the
performance of our approach by iteratively refining the model in search of the best fit. We describe
the design, approach, and outcomes for each application in the following subsections.

3.1 Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets
Classifying sentiment on social media is a notoriously difficult problem for computational methods.
Dictionary-based methods, which measure sentiment by counting the frequency of positive and
negative words, tend to perform poorly when faced with text where positive words imply negative
sentiment (“thanks for nothing”, “smooth move”, “way to go, genius”) and negative words imply
positive sentiment (“that was wicked/sick/demented!”). And conventional supervised learning
methods using a bag of words approach—even when trained on millions of social media posts—can
at best correctly classify the sentiment of a test set roughly 80% of the time (Go, Bhayani and
Huang, 2009). In such an environment, the ability of contextualized word embeddings to flexibly
adjust their representation of a word in response to its context can be quite beneficial, and models
based on the transformer architecture have rapidly become the state-of-the-art in social media
sentiment analysis (Camacho-Collados et al., 2022; Widmann and Wich, 2022).
For our first application, we compare measures of sentiment produced by LLM prompts against
three automated methods for sentiment classification broadly familiar to political scientists. The
first is a dictionary-based method, which classifies sentiment based on counts of words associated
with positive or negative sentiment. The second is a supervised learner (Naive Bayes), trained
on a bag of words representation. The third is a transformer model (RoBERTa) fine-tuned for
sentiment classification of Twitter posts (Camacho-Collados et al., 2022). This application illustrates
a core strength of the few-shot prompt approach: it improves performance in cases where accurately
classifying a document requires knowledge of the political context in which it was written.
We collect a novel dataset of 945 Twitter posts (“tweets”) that reference the United States Supreme
Court within 24 hours of two controversial opinions: Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado
Civil Rights Commission (2018), as well as the Court’s concurrently released opinions in Trump
v. Mazars andTrump v. Vance (2020). We chose these cases to reflect a diverse set of users and
political issues, including anti-discriminatory practices towards same-sex couples, religious liberties
for private business owners, and the legal immunity of Donald Trump as both the president and a
private citizen. For each tweet in this dataset, we created an author-labeled sentiment score through
a two-stage manual coding procedure. The three authors began by independently labeling a set
of 1,000 tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. From that original set, we excluded 55 tweets
8


<!-- page 9 -->

that were unrelated to the US Supreme Court decisions, and conducted a second round of manual
labeling for any tweets where at least two authors disagreed about the direction of sentiment. The
result is a 7-point measure of sentiment ranging from -1 (all authors agreed the tweet was negative)
to +1 (all authors agreed the tweet was positive).4
For many tweets in this dataset, it would be difficult to accurately classify sentiment without
understanding the context in which they were written. Consider the following example, posted in
response to the Court’s decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop (2018):
“Way to go SCOTUS! You really celebrated PRIDE Month.”
All three authors agreed that this was a sarcastic remark expressing negative sentiment about the
Court’s decision, but reaching that conclusion required knowing that in its Masterpiece opinion, the
Supreme Court ruled in favor of a baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.
Without this knowledge, even a high-performing sentiment analysis model would incorrectly classify
the tweet as positive.
A principal advantage of the LLM approach is that one can provide this context to the model within
the prompt itself, rather than having to train or fine-tune a new model. For tweets referencing the
Masterpiece decision, we provided GPT-3 and GPT-4 with the prompt shown in Table 1.
The structure of this prompt contains a few important components. First, the prompt includes a
set of instructions describing the classification task and any necessary context, in much the same
way that one would brief a human research assistant. Next, the prompt can include one or more
completed examples. The prompt in Table 1 is known as a “few-shot” prompt (Brown et al., 2020),
because it provides several examples of an appropriate response before providing the text to be
classified. When designing prompts, a researcher must decide how many (and which) examples to
include.
4Inter-coder reliability as measured by Fleiss’ kappa was 0.72, and at least two authors agreed on the label for
every tweet.

<!-- page 10 -->

Table 1. LLM prompt for sentiment classification task
Prior to conducting our analysis, we pre-registered the text of two prompts, one to classify tweets
collected after the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision (Table 1) and the other to classify tweets following
theMazarsandVancedecisions (see Supplementary Materials for the full text of the second prompt).
Both prompts include a brief set of instructions describing the Supreme Court’s ruling, followed
by six few-shot example completions. Each example was drawn from the set of tweets that the
authors unanimously coded—two positive, two neutral, and two negative to avoid biasing the model
towards a particular classification (Zhao et al., 2021). This approach to prompt design—modifying
the prompt with different preambles and examples depending on context—outperforms every other
method we attempted.5
For each prompt, the LLM outputs the probabilities that the subsequent word will be Positive,
Negative, or Neutral. From this probability vector we construct a continuous measure of sentiment
for every tweet in the dataset (per our pre-registration protocol, we take the first component of
5In the Supplementary Materials (Appendix A), we experiment with zero-shot prompts (no labeled examples) and
one-shot prompts (one labeled example), as well as “default” prompts that do not provide context about the Supreme
Court cases. As expected, providing the model with context in the preamble significantly improves performance, as
does providing more few-shot examples.
10


<!-- page 11 -->

a principal component analysis).The resulting measure of sentiment is strongly correlated with
our hand-coded measure, as illustrated in Figure 1. GPT-3 correctly predicts whether a tweet
was negative or positive in 88.4% of cases. For comparison, the TweetNLP model—a RoBERTa
transformer model fine-tuned for Twitter sentiment analysis—correctly classifies 64.3% of these
tweets. The best dictionary-based method we could construct only classifies 38.3% of the tweets
correctly, and a Naive Bayes classifier trained on 1.2 million tweets from the Go, Bhayani and
Huang (2009) dataset classified 57.7% correctly—barely better than a coin flip. See Appendix C for
a detailed description of how we trained these alternative sentiment classifiers.
Surprisingly, the latest generation of OpenAI language models (GPT-4) performs slightly worseon
this task than few-shot prompts to GPT-3. As the figure makes clear, estimates from GPT-4 are
strongly correlated with the author-coded labels, but the estimated probabilities tend to be poorly
calibrated and overconfident. For over 70% of these social media posts, GPT-4 returns an estimated
probability greater than 99% for a single sentiment label. It is also substantially more likely to
return a “Neutral” sentiment label than the authors. Because models like GPT-4 are optimized for
chat-based applications through a process called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
(Ouyang et al., 2022), the probability distributions they return are not necessarily well-calibrated for
next word prediction. We discuss the implications of this finding in more detail in the Discussion.
To see why the LLM classifiers so dramatically outperformed other automated methods of sentiment
classification, consider Table 3, which presents a sample of tweets from the dataset. The sentiment
of each of these tweets is ambiguous without knowledge of the political context in which they were
written. For a reader familiar with the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, the first two tweets are
obviously sarcastic statements reflecting disappointment with the ruling. And for a reader familiar
with the MazarsandVancerulings, the third and fourth tweets appear express a positive sentiment
regarding the outcome. Few-shot prompting’s ability to incorporate this information puts it at an
advantage over conventional sentiment classification methods.
The strongest test of the approach, however, is not whether it outperforms other automated methods,
but whether it can perform at the level of non-expert human coders. This is the focus of our next
two applications.

3.2 Political Ad Tone
Crowd-sourced text analysis is one of the fastest, most reliable methods for manually coding texts,
leveraging the “wisdom of crowds” to generate measures from a large collection of non-expert
judgments (Surowiecki, 2004; Benoit et al., 2016). By asking human coders to conduct a series of
pairwise comparisons (e.g. “which of these tweets is more negative?”), Carlson and Montgomery
(2017) show that a researcher can quickly generate measures of sentiment that strongly correlate
with expert judgments.
Nevertheless, this approach has several shortcomings. First, it requires the researcher to screen,
train, and monitor crowd-workers to ensure attentiveness and inter-coder reliability. Second, it can
be quite costly. To measure the tone of 935 political ads, Carlson and Montgomery (2017) required
9,420 pairwise comparison tasks at 6 cents per task, for a total cost of $565.20. Although Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk ( MTurk) is currently the most economical alternative on the market, that reduced
cost is borne by the coders completing the tasks. Studies suggest that people performing “human
intelligence tasks” on sites like MTurk,CrowdFlower ,Clickworker , andTolunaearn a median hourly
wage of roughly $2/hour, and only 4% earn more than the US federal minimum wage of $7.25 (Hara
et al., 2018). As a result, crowd-workers have an incentive to quickly complete as many tasks as
possible, which can undermine the quality of crowd-sourced measures. Unsurprisingly, as LLMs
13


<!-- page 14 -->

have become more ubiquitous, many crowd workers have begun to rely on them to enhance their
productivity. In a recent study, researchers estimated that between one-third and one-half of crowd
workers used ChatGPT to complete a text summarization task (Veselovsky, Ribeiro and West,
2023).
In this application, we explore whether the few-shot LLM approach can reproduce Carlson and
Montgomery’s (2017) crowd-sourced measure of political ad tone, using the one-shot prompt in
Table 4. As in the tweet sentiment application, we construct a continuous measure of tone from the
model’s estimated probability vector.
Table 4. LLM Prompt for Political Ad Tone Task
Coding the 935 political ads from Carlson and Montgomery (2017) took less than 1 minute and cost
$0.60—a nearly thousand-fold reduction in cost compared to crowd-coding.6And yet the resulting
measure of ad tone was just as strongly correlated with expert ratings, as illustrated in Figure 2.
6This cost is based on OpenAI’s per-token pricing schedule as of April 2024. For more discussion on the likely
trends in costs for LLMs relative to human crowd-coders, see the Conclusion.

<!-- page 15 -->

Figure 2: Comparing crowd-coded, GPT-3, and GPT-4 estimates to expert-coded political ad tone
(Carlson & Montgomery 2017)
15


<!-- page 16 -->

Our measure diverges from the expert ratings in one of two situations. First, there are some ads in
the dataset that are quite negative in tone, but the expert coders classify them as positive because
they do not attack a specificopponent (focusing instead on “typical Washington politicians” or
“Republicans”). Second, some ads require contextual knowledge to accurately classify. Table A4
in the Appendix provides some examples of ads where our approach and the experts disagreed.
The first two ads are negative in tone, but target “Washington” and “other other side”, so are not
labeled attack ads by the expert coders. The third ad requires contextual knowledge about Susan
Collins’ failure to keep a campaign promise, context which is not provided in the ad text or our
prompt instructions. And the final ad—illustrated by the point in the lower right corner of Figure
2—is arguably miscoded by the experts.
3.3 Ideology Scaling
Our third application is a document scaling task, designed to assess whether LLM prompts can
accurately place the ideology of political texts on a continuous scale. The approach we take is, in
essence, to treat the LLM as if it were a non-expert human coder, replicating the procedure for
crowd-sourcing party manifesto positions from Benoit et al. (2016). This allows us to validate our
approach against an extensive set of crowd-coded classifications for 18,263 sentences from 18 British
party manifestos written between 1987 and 2010. By replicating these results, we can also test
whether the model can be adapted to a very different context than the bulk of its training data,
both geographically (Britain instead of the United States) and temporally (up to 35 years ago).
We adhere to the crowd-coding procedure from Benoit et al. (2016) as closely as possible, first
splitting the manifestos into their component sentences. We then classify the policy content of each
sentence using the one-shot “Policy Prompt” in Table 5. For any sentences that refer primarily
to Social Policy or Economic Policy, we classify their ideology on a three-point scale using the
one-shot Ideology Prompt in Table 5. As in the sentiment classification tasks, GPT-3 outputs a
probability distribution of next word predictions. From these, we assign each sentence an ideology
score equal to the model’s estimated Conservative probability minus its estimated Liberal probability.
We aggregate these scores to the manifesto level by taking the average score for Economic Policy
passages and the average score for Social Policy passages.
16


<!-- page 17 -->

To generate our GPT-4 measures, we break from our pre-registrated protocol, adopting the approach
described in Le Mens and Gallego (2023), which explicitly prompts GPT-4 for a continuous measure
of ideology. The advantage of this approach is that it can utilize GPT-4’s larger context window—the
model can generate predictions from inputs with over 100,000 tokens, roughly three times the length
of the average manifesto in our corpus—to produce estimates without having to first split each
manifesto into its component sentences. As in the first two applications, however, the measures
produced by GPT-4 are little or no better than those we obtain using GPT-3. See Appendix B for
more details.
Table 5. LLM Prompt for Ideology Scaling Task
Figure 3 plots the performance of the crowd-coded estimates (top panel) and the GPT-3 estimates
(bottom panel). Our estimates are more strongly correlated with expert ratings on the Economic
policy dimension (ρ= 0.92)than the Social policy dimension (ρ= 0.8), and are better at capturing
between-party variance than within-party variance (though note that this is true for the crowd-coded
17

compared to expert scores.

<!-- page 19 -->

measure as well). Despite its limitations, the GPT-3 approach yields estimates that correlate
strongly with human-coded measures at a small fraction of the cost. Crowd-coding 18,263 manifesto
sentences cost Benoit et al. (2016) approximately $3,226.7By comparison, the GPT-3 estimates
cost approximately $2.50 at current prices. This has enormous practical implications, as it allows
researchers to scale a substantially larger corpus of documents using LLMs than they could with
human coders.
3.4 Topic Modeling
As useful as these models are for measurement and classification, they may hold even more promise
as a tool for discovery (Grimmer, Roberts and Stewart, 2021). Often a researcher will approach a
new corpus of documents without a preconceived notion about how to partition them into categories.
For any given corpus, there is an unfathomably large number of possible partitions, and statistical
models can aid in the process of discovering interesting ones. A workhorse approach for this type
oftopic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 2003). Each word
in each document is assumed to be drawn from one of ktopics, where the value of kis chosen by
the researcher. Each topic is represented by a vector of term probabilities, and each document
is assigned a set of weights (summing to 1) representing the mixture of topics contained in the
document. LDA searches for a set of topics and document assignments that maximizes the likelihood
of generating the observed “bag of words”.
This approach to topic modeling has three significant drawbacks. First, it requires the researcher
to have a large corpus of text with which to train the model. LDA is an unsupervised learning
technique, so unlike supervised learning models it does not require large amounts of hand-labeled
training data. Nevertheless, it performs better with more data, so that the model can identify the
most common terms in each topic cluster. A researcher could not effectively use LDA, for example,
to classify the topics of fifty newspaper articles; one would first need thousands of newspaper articles
to effectively train the model.
Second, interpreting a fitted LDA model requires a fair amount of subjective judgment. The topics
generated by LDA are unlabeled, and the researcher must make sense of them by comparing the most

probable words in each topic against those from other topics. While there are promising methods for
crowd-sourcing this judgment task (Ying, Montgomery and Stewart, 2021), they require additional
time, cost, and considerations involving crowd-worker recruitment, training, and monitoring.
Third, a researcher fitting an LDA model has little control over the kindsof topics they would like
to explore in the data. A given corpus might have a large number of sensible ways to partition
the document space, but LDA only produces one—the partition that maximizes the likelihood
of the observed document-term matrix. For example, the dataset we explore in this application
comes from Wilkerson and Casas (2017), who fit a series of LDA models to identify the topics
from 9,704 one-minute floor speeches by members of the US House of Representatives during the
113th Congress (2013–2014). Based on reporting from the Congressional Research Service, we
know that Congress members use these speeches as an opportunity to highlight legislation, thank
colleagues and constituents, give truncated eulogies, and express policy positions (Schneider, 2015).
Though Wilkerson and Casas (2017) focus their analysis on partisan differences in substantive topics
(e.g. education, defense, agriculture, etc.), one might imagine a large number of other interesting
ways to categorize the speeches. For instance, many of the floor speeches are dedicated to honoring
a constituent or organization for some achievement. One sensible partition would be to categorize
speeches by the type of person being honored. Another would be to categorize the type of action
being honored, or the virtues being praised. Because LDA represents documents as a bag of words,
it is unable to distinguish between these different kinds of meaning.
By contrast, a large language model can be flexibly adapted to discover many different sorts
of topics, just by changing the prompt instructions. To demonstrate, we provide the prompt
in Table 6 to GPT-3 for each of 9,565 speeches8from the Wilkerson and Casas (2017) dataset.
We are interested in exploring whether there are partisan differences in the set of “virtues”
that are praised in these speeches. Consistent with Moral Foundations Theory (Graham, Haidt
and Nosek, 2009), we might expect conservatives to emphasize virtues like loyalty, patriotism,
and hard work in their speeches, while liberals would be more likely to emphasize fairness,
compassion, and charity. The approach is analogous to keyword-assisted topic models (Eshima, Imai
andSasaki,2024), inthatitallowstheresearchertospecifywhichconceptsareofsubstantiveinterest.
8We omit 139 speeches with more than 6,000 characters to avoid exceeding an API token limit.
20

Table 6. LLM Prompt for Topic Modeling Application
GPT-3 returned a list of 51,483 topic labels (roughly 5-6 per speech).9Unlike a typical LDA output—
an unlabeled list of term frequencies—these topic labels required minimal subjective judgment to
interpret. The only post-processing we conducted was to group together synonymous and related
terms (e.g. grouping together “compassion”, “compassionate”, and “compassionate care”). Figure 4
plots the partisan differences in the share of speeches that mention a given virtue.
Democrats were more likely than Republicans to praise advocacy (+3.5%), charity (+1.5%),
compassion (+3.9%), education (+3.3%), and fairness (+3%). Republicans were more likely to
praise bravery (+2%), patriotism (+4.2%), loyalty (+2.1%), sacrifice (+2.8%), and success (+7.7%).
These results are broadly consistent with our expectations, but the method also allowed us to
discover several patterns we did not anticipate, in particular the partisan divides on advocacy,
education, and success.
9See Appendix D for a list of the most frequent topic labels by party.
21

Figure 4: Share of speeches mentioning a virtue (and its synonyms) by political party. Note: We
include the following synonyms in each category: bravery (brave, fearless, heroic, gallant, valiant,
courage, valor); loyalty (loyal, dutiful, duty, steadfast, devoted, allegiant); patriotism (patriot); hard
work (hard work, industrious, assiduous, diligent); fairness (equitable, equity, egalitarian, equal,
impartiality); compassion (kindness, empathy, humanity, caring); charity (philanthropic, benevolent,
beneficence), success(achievement, merit), education(mentorship, knowledge, intelligence), advocacy
(activism), sacrifice (selflessness).
22


<!-- page 23 -->

To assess the quality these speech labels, we performed an Optimal Label validation task as proposed
by Ying, Montgomery and Stewart (2021). For a random sample of 400 speeches, we asked a human
coder (blinded to the study’s results) to select the best label from a set of four choices. One of
the choices was the actual label assigned by GPT-3 and the other three were randomly selected
“intruder” labels from Figure 4. In 80% of cases, the human coder agreed with GPT-3’s choice
of label, well above the 25% one would expect by chance. Though imperfect, this result suggests
that our approach is sufficiently precise to meaningfully distinguish between topic labels, at a level
comparable to a “careful” human coder assigning topic labels from LDA (Ying, Montgomery and
Stewart, 2021).
It is interesting to note here that the LLM is not simply operating as a sophisticated dictionary
method, classifying texts based on whether they contain a given virtue-related word. For example,
over half of the speeches in the corpus (5,332) contain the word “honor”, typically in the context of
honoring some person or organization (e.g. “Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Monsignor
Francis Maniola...”). It would be a mistake to classify those speeches as praising the virtueof
honor, and reassuringly, GPT-3 only classifies 145 speeches as praising honor—nearly all of them
speeches about soldiers or veterans.
4 Discussion
Across a range of tasks and substantive domains, the few-shot LLM approach significantly outper-
forms existing automated approaches, and performs comparably to teams of human coders at a
small fraction of the time and financial cost. In our view, political scientists should strongly consider
using few-shot prompts to large language models for any text classification task for which they
might otherwise employ teams of non-expert coders.
However, this recommendation comes with a number of important caveats. First and foremost, we
caution against assuming that this approach will work “out of the box” without careful validation
(Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). As with any machine learning method for capturing latent concepts
(Knox, Lucas and Cho, 2022), the measures produced by LLMs can be sensitive to researcher
choices—particularly during prompt design—and the best way to guard against bias is by comparing
23


<!-- page 24 -->

the model’s predictions against human-coded labels. For any new application of large language
models, we recommend a three-step process. First, set aside a small randomly-selected subset of the
data, hand-labeled by the researcher, to aid in prompt design. The goal of the first step is to create
a prompt that will reliably generate the gold-standard labels for these observations. Once satisfied
with the design of the prompt, use the adapted model to generate predicted classifications for a
second, larger, validation set. This set should also be hand-labeled, either by the research team or
crowd-coders, to verify that the predictions produced by the model are strongly correlated with
ground truth. Only after passing this validation test should the LLM be applied to the remaining,
unlabeled texts.
Researchers should also not assume that the “latest and greatest” LLM will always be the best choice
for social science applications. Many LLMs released since 2022—including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and
GPT-4—have been modified through a process of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
(RLHF), a procedure which fine-tunes the model’s parameters so that it produces outputs that human
raters are more likely to find desirable (Ouyang et al., 2022). Though these models are superior for
applications like Q&A and chat, we have demonstrated that they frequently underperform on the
sorts of classification and scaling tasks we explore in this paper. Although measures generated by
GPT-4 are still strongly correlated with the human-coded ground truth, they tend to be overconfident
compared to those produced by the original version of GPT-3. Once again, careful validation can
help a researcher determine which LLM variant will be the most useful for a given task.
This highlights another problem with researchers relying on proprietary, closed-source LLMs for
their work: the reproducibility of such results depends on for-profit organizations like OpenAI
continuing to support those models in perpetuity. This is unlikely to be in these firms’ financial
interest, as there is more money to be made from consumers of chat products than from academic
researchers. Indeed, the GPT-3 models that we used to produce the paper’s results were removed
from the public-facing API in January 2024. Unless OpenAI decides to publicly release these models’
weights, researchers will be unable to reproduce those results exactly. This is a significant step
back for open science (Spirling, 2023), which has made great strides in recent years fostering the
norm that research findings be computationally reproducible and open-source. Fortunately, a large
number of open-source LLMs are being actively developed (Scao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022;
24


<!-- page 25 -->

Touvron et al., 2023), and we anticipate that within a few years there will be many such alternatives
available to researchers that are as high-performing and straightforward to use as OpenAI’s offerings
are today.
Researchers should also be aware of the biases encoded in large language models and how they
might affect their research. Because models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 are trained on a large corpus of
text written by humans, they tend to mimic many of the falsehoods and prejudices contained in
those texts. Posing a series of 817 questions associated with common misconceptions, Lin, Hilton
and Evans (2021) find that GPT-3 responds truthfully only 58% of the time. For example, when
prompted with “Who really caused 9/11?”, the model often mentions “the US government” or
“the Bush administration” in its responses. Pretrained word embeddings tend to reflect prejudicial
patterns in human speech—vectors encoding stereotypically Black names tend to be closer in space to
words related to unpleasant feelings, female names tend to be closer to family-related words and male
names closer to career-related words (Caliskan, Bryson and Narayanan, 2017). Contextualized word
embeddings appear to share many of these biases, and LLMs will generate hate speech, particularly
Islamophobia, with very little prompting (see Abid, Farooqi and Zou (2021) for an overview). The
RLHF process used to fine-tune models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 was developed specifically to
address these problems, though as we have seen this can come at the cost of predictive accuracy.
Putting all this together, we advise researchers to be cautious applying LLMs to tasks where a smart
parrot spewing falsehoods, conspiracy theories, and hate speech would prove harmful. For instance,
such models are unlikely to perform well at the sort of crowd-sourced data collection tasks proposed
by Sumner, Farris and Holman (2020), which would require the model to return up-to-date, factual
information. As always, validation is key. Before generating automated classifications for one’s
entire dataset, researchers should check the accuracy of the model’s classifications on a hand-coded
sample of texts. If it is performing poorly, consider modifying the prompt, adding few-shot examples,
or using human coders.10.
10Of course, human coders are likely to suffer from many of these same biases. After all, LLMs learned their
prejudices from human-authored texts.

5 Conclusion
We believe that the approach we’ve described has the potential to be transformative for political
science research. Not only can it reliably perform existing text-as-data tasks, but it opens up a
broad range of research questions that were previously infeasible. And because of its cost advantages
compared to manual coding, these models can help broaden the pool of researchers who can fruitfully
engage in text-as-data research, allowing individual researchers to analyze large corpora of data
that would otherwise require teams of experts, crowds of human coders, and large research budgets.
As with most computing technologies, it is reasonable to expect that these costs will only continue
to decrease in the near future. After all, the field is moving very fast. Since we first began work on
this project in the fall of 2021, the computing cost of our applications has decreased thirtyfold.
To aid political scientists applying this approach to their own research, we are releasing
an open-source software package in the Rprogramming language that creates a straight-
forward interface for formatting prompts and classifying texts, available for download at

A Appendix A: Additional Tables and Figures
To explore how the size and complexity of the model affects its classification performance, we
iteratively tested multiple GPT-3 variants (2.7 billion, 7 billion, 13 billion, and 175 billion parameters)
using prompts structured as follows:
In addition to varying the number of model parameters, we vary whether the prompt is zero-shot,
one-shot, or few-shot, using the examples listed in Table B1.
Table A1. Few-Shot Examples for Sentiment Classification Task
Figure A1 and Table A2 report performance across every combination of model and prompt variant.
31


<!-- page 32 -->

As expected, larger models generally outperform smaller models, and providing more examples in the
prompt consistently improves performance. The smallest model variants (2.7b and 6.7b parameters)
perform quite poorly, requiring few-shot learning before their output is even modestly correlated
with the expert scores. But the two largest variants perform well regardless of prompt design
choices. The 175-billion parameter GPT-3 predicts whether a tweet was negative or positive in
87.5% of cases with one-shot learning, and 88.4% of the time with few-shot learning. The 13-billion
parameter variant performs nearly as well, with accuracies of 85.1% for one-shot learning and 87.4%
for few-shot learning. Choosing a less-capable variant of the model may be advantageous for some
researchers, since (as of October 2022) these models are only available through OpenAI’s paid
Application Programming Interface (API), and the per-token rate for 13-billion parameter variant is
ten times less expensive than the full 175-billion parameter variant. For a dataset this size, however,
the costs were minimal. In total, coding our 945 tweets cost $4.86 with one-shot prompting and
175b parameters, versus $0.46 with 13b parameters.

taking the probability-weighted average score returned by the model. For the sentiment analysis

C Appendix C: Alternative Methods of Sentiment Classification
For the Twitter sentiment analysis task, we apply three variations of dictionary-based classifiers:
BING (Hu & Liu 2004), a customized BING model, and Sentimentr (Jockers 2017). BING and
Sentimentr represent different classes of dictionary-based classifiers that use adjacency matching
with a pre-defined list of positive and negative terms to derive sentiment associations. At its core,
the BING lexicon tokenizes text strings and derives a sentiment classification for each word based on
a pre-defined lexicon. By comparison, Sentimentr classifications build on the BING-style framework
by further considering the possibility of inversion rhetoric. That is, while BING associates individual
words as positive or negative without any concern for their placement or usage, Sentimentr’s added
parameters allow it to consider conditional adverb qualifiers that might negate subsequent or
preceding verbs or adjectives. For example, consider the following string: “ The Supreme Court’s
recent decisions are not good .” A reliable classifier would be able to discern the negative sentiment.
However, using BING and Sentimentr reveal divergent classifications that reflect their underlying
parameters. Whereas Sentimentr accurately classified the string as negative (-0.08), BING actually
returned a positive score (+2). BING merely observed the words supreme andgoodas positive
qualifiers, while Sentimentr observed the inversion qualifier “not” as an indication that the sentiment
was actually negative. To help reinforce BING’s classifications, we included a separate classification
model that removed certain terms that might increase the propensity for misclassifications. We
specifically removed supreme,court,trump,masterpiece ,judge, andpride,all of which were terms
that frequently appeared in the Court-related tweets but could be interpreted as adjectives or verbs
promoting positive or negative sentiments when they are actually being used as nouns.
