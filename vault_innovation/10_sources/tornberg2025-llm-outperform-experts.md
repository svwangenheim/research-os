Abstract
Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful new tool
for text analysis. As these models are capable of zero-shot annotation based on instructions
written in natural language, they obviate the need of large sets of training data—and thus bring
potential paradigm-shifting implications for using text as data. While the models show substantial
promise, their relative performance compared to human coders and supervised models remains
poorly understood and subject to signiﬁcant academic debate. This paper assesses the strengths
and weaknesses of popular ﬁne-tuned AI models compared to both conventional supervised
classiﬁers and manual annotation by experts and crowd workers. The task used is to identify the
political afﬁliation of politicians based on a single X/Twitter message, focusing on data from 11
different countries. The paper ﬁnds that GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy than both supervised
models and human coders across all languages and country contexts. In the US context, it achieves
an accuracy of 0.934 and an inter-coder reliability of 0.982. Examining the cases where the models
fail, the paper ﬁnds that the LLM—unlike the supervised models—correctly annotates messages
that require interpretation of implicit or unspoken references, or reasoning on the basis of
contextual knowledge—capacities that have traditionally been understood to be distinctly human.
The paper thus contributes to our understanding of the revolutionary implications of LLMs for
text analysis within the social sciences.

Introduction

Social Science Computer Review 43(6)

Texts are culturally and socially situated within the ideas, values, and beliefs about the world
within which humans operate. Their interpretation often requires deep contextual knowledge and
the ability to “put ourselves in the shoes of others”—seen as distinctly human resources and
capacities (Ramsay, 2011). While interpretation lies at the very heart of the social sciences, it has
thus been seen as almost deﬁnitionally qualitative; “meaning has to be understood, it cannot be
measured or counted, and hence there is always an interpretive or hermeneutic element in social
science” (Sayer, 2000, p. 17).

While computational methods for analyzing and annotating textual data have evolved rapidly
in recent years—enabling analysis of large-scale textual data (Eisenstein, 2019)—they have
struggled with tasks requiring more complex interpretative capacities. Existing computational
annotation methods often fall short when dealing with irony, metaphors, sarcasm, and implicit or
unsaid meaning (Moretti, 2013; Ramsay, 2011; T¨ornberg & Uitermark, 2021). Supervised models,
which are trained on a single classiﬁcation task, face signiﬁcant challenges in generalizing to data
outside their training data, making them less useful for comparative research, and when robust and
appropriate training data is unavailable. Moreover, these models typically require substantial
amounts of training data, which means manual annotation remains necessary even with the use of
supervised models. Consequently, manual annotation continues to be pervasive in social science
research, relying on expert coders (e.g., colleagues, trained students, or research assistants) or
online crowd workers. However, manual annotation is also not without its own issues (Murthy
et al., 2019; Van Atteveldt et al., 2021), as humans can be slow, costly, biased, and prone to fatigue,
all of which can undermine data quality and limit the scope of analysis (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013;
Neuendorf, 2017). As a result, large-scale text analysis has remained a relatively costly and
challenging endeavor.

The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has however offered hopes of
overcoming some of these limitations. LLMs such as GPT have shown the capacity for few-shot
and zero-shot classiﬁcation: by using carefully formulated natural language instructions, the
LLMs can be used to directly annotate data—without the need for any manually labeled training
data (Bail, 2024; Brown et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2022; T¨ornberg, 2024a). The capacity for zero-
shot learning means that no training data is provided, and that the model performs tasks or makes
predictions on topics it has not been explicitly trained on, by leveraging its understanding of
language patterns and context. As the LLMs are trained on truly massive datasets, they build
extensive internal models of the world, allowing them to carry out virtually any coding task—and
possibly allows them also to move beyond the limitations of previous generations of compu-
tational text analysis. Unlike traditional supervised models, LLMs like GPT are trained not only to
classify text but also to understand context and provide accurate responses through techniques like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), enabling them to follow instructions
more accurately and explain their reasoning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2024).

While the models show substantial promise, the relative performance of zero-shot learning
LLMs in comparison to conventional supervised models and manual coding remains poorly
understood and subject to signiﬁcant academic debate (Ding et al., 2023; Gilardi et al., 2023; He
et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Ziems et al., 2024). There are several limitations in existing studies of
the capacities of LLMs. First, we have limited knowledge when it comes to the models’ strengths
and weakness in relation to speciﬁc interpretative capacities—such as understanding sarcasm and
irony, subjective interpretation, identifying the unsaid and implicit, or making contextual in-
ferences. Second, since research examining the capacities of the models tends to use human
annotation as the ground truth, we have limited understanding how well the models fare relative to
human coders. Using such manually coded data as ground truth is furthermore problematic when

T¨ornberg

comparing LLMs with supervised models, as the task then involves not only correct classiﬁcation
but also reproducing the errors of the human coders. This offers an intrinsic advantage for the
supervised models, as these are trained on data produced by the same coders. Finally, little is
known how well the models fare across language and national contexts, as research has focused
primarily on evaluating their capacity on the English language and the US context. As the model
training data also emphasizes this context, the models may perform substantially worse for other
languages and cultural contexts.

This brief paper contributes to addressing these gaps. We focus on the task of coding the
political party of a politician based on an X/Twitter message across 11 countries, with different
languages and cultural contexts—a task for which ground truth is available, but which still
requires challenging forms of interpretative skills that are common to annotation tasks within the
social sciences. We compare zero-shot GPT-4 annotation with two supervised models—one Na¨ıve
Bayes bag-of-words classiﬁer model as a baseline and a BERT model—as well as crowd workers
and expert human coders. We focus speciﬁcally on cases where the cases where the classiﬁers fail,
to examine what type of interpretation appears particularly challenging for each type of model.
We ﬁnd that the zero-shot GPT-4 outperforms all other methods—both the MTurk crowd
workers and the expert human classiﬁers, as well as the supervised BERT classiﬁer and the Na¨ıve
Bayes classiﬁer. While the performance is lower outside the United States, the model still achieves
relatively high accuracy across countries and languages—without the need for context-speciﬁc
training data. The LLM is furthermore stable to variations in instructions for the given task. More
interestingly, the LLM appears to operate according to a different logic than conventional
computational models. While the supervised models struggle with certain interpretative tasks that
are trivial for humans, the LLM solves these and appears to draw on interpretative skills that have
previously been seen as distinctly human, such as making inferences based on contextual
understanding.

While the ﬁndings of the paper contribute to the emerging view of LLMs as representing a
paradigm shift in text-as-data, it should be noted that LLMs also pose signiﬁcant challenges—not
least epistemologically. LLMs require new ways of thinking of computational text annotation,
calling for an annotation process that is in some ways more akin to conventional human text
coding. We discuss the implications, risks, and limitations of using LLMs for text-as-data, as well
as relevant pitfalls and best practices.

Large Language Models
Instruction-tuned LLMs have recently revolutionized the ﬁeld of natural language processing.
These models, brought to fame by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, employ deep learning to process and
produce human-like text (Chung et al., 2024). While smaller versions of these transformer-based
language models functioned like a form of sophisticated autocomplete, the larger models that are
fed extensive corpora display capacities for which they were not explicitly trained. LLMs
demonstrate a remarkable understanding of language nuances, context, and semantics (Brown
et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2019), and capacities ranging from text generation and summarization to
sentiment analysis and thematic categorization.

Studies have found that these models are also not only capable of text annotation, but that they
have several potential advantages compared to conventional text annotation methods (Wei et al.,
2022). Whereas supervised models must be speciﬁcally trained for each task, zero-shot learning
models leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generalize across a multitude of tasks (Yin et al.,
2019). While conventional supervised models thus require signiﬁcant quantities of often manually
labeled data, LLMs are capable of so-called “zero-shot learning”: they can execute annotation

1184

Social Science Computer Review 43(6)

tasks based on natural language instructions, without the need of task-speciﬁc training data
(Brown et al., 2020).

Zero-shot learning has signiﬁcant implications for text annotation in the social sciences, as it
means that a single model can be used for a broad range of tasks, and since prompts are written in
natural language, the process is simple and more akin to giving instructions to a human coder than
training a complex computational model. This has signiﬁcant democratizing implications for
academic research, as it makes sophisticated text analysis available for scholars less experienced
in computational methods, and to substantially lower costs than conventional supervised models,
as it reduces the need for manually labeled training data. If LLMs indeed prove reliable for text
annotation, the implications may thus be signiﬁcant for the social sciences, as the models are easy-
to-use, relatively cheap, and highly versatile. However, our understanding of the strengths and
limitations of these models remains limited, with studies ﬁnding conﬂicting levels of accuracy and
reliability (Ding et al., 2023; Gilardi et al., 2023; He et al., 2023; Ollion et al., 2024; Zhu et al.,
2023; Ziems et al., 2024).

Annotation Task

To examine the performance of LLMs, we will use the example task of annotating messages from
the social media platform Twitter (now X) based on the political belonging of the poster. The data
used were drawn from van Vliet et al.’s (2020) database of messages from parliamentarians across
countries over several years. Using such messages has the advantage of offering a ground truth: we
know the posters political afﬁliations and can therefore objectively assess the accuracy of GPT-4
compared to human coders. This bypasses the problems associated to the common practice of
treating human annotation as the ground truth. (Supplementary Material S1 carries out a cor-
responding analysis on a sample of randomly selected users, to verify that the model achieves
similar performance on users for which ground truth is not publicly available).

The task is furthermore rich in terms of the interpretative challenges that it involves. The
messages in the dataset consist of a mix between expressions of view on particular policy po-
sitions, comments on recent political events, self-congratulatory messages for political victories,
calls for campaign contributions, and the occasional personal news. Some of the messages can be
easily classiﬁed—such as laudatory references to the party leader, or attacks against the opposing
party. Others require parsing often implicit references and drawing on detailed contextual
knowledge about politics (such as the US parties’ positions on the construction of a local airport in
Oklahoma, or the Swedish parties’ views on the size of the arctic wolf population). Others still
require the capacity to consider the author’s underlying intention and how they are communicating
to their intended audience of voters. Finally, a signiﬁcant share of the messages is nearly im-
possible to guess, such as birthday wishes to staff members, or messages with politically neutral
content or even content associated with an opposing party. Accurately annotating the messages
thus requires a broad range of interpretative skills, which allows us to use the messages to examine
the respective strengths and weaknesses of the included methods. Even with such skills, complete
accuracy should not be expected.

The LLM was run on all countries that had elections during the time period covered by the
database and for which at least 100 messages were posted for each included party during the
relevant period. The messages were generally written in the local language of the country, al-
lowing us to test the model’s capacity across multiple languages. For these countries, the two
largest parties in parliament prior to the election were selected. From this dataset, shares (“re-
tweets”) and replies were removed, as were messages containing a URL and those shorter than 100
characters, since these were assumed to be too brief to contain meaningful political content. A
random sample of 250 messages from each of the two major parties was selected, resulting in a

T¨ornberg

1185

balanced sample of 500 messages. These relatively small datasets were chosen deliberately to
allow for manual analysis of annotation failures and to evaluate the model’s performance under
challenging conditions. For Sweden, New Zealand, and Poland, where fewer than 250 messages
matched the criteria during the time period, 100 messages per party were used. Although bag-of-
words models tend to perform better with larger datasets, the smaller samples provide an op-
portunity to demonstrate the capacity of LLMs to handle classiﬁcation tasks effectively even with
limited data, highlighting their value as coding tools when human coding resources are con-
strained. The supervised models, by contrast, were trained on a larger sample of 5000 messages
from each of the two parties across the entire time period covered by the dataset, excluding any
messages in the test set. The task hence consisted of binary, balanced classiﬁcation, allowing for
easy interpretation and analysis.

Methods

For all the included countries, we compare the performance of the LLM with two supervised
models: a simple Na¨ıve Bayes bag-of-words model and a BERT model. For the US case, we also
use the crowd-work platform MTurk as well as human experts to enable comparing the LLM with
the gold standard. We compare the models using the standard metrics for classiﬁcation perfor-
mance: accuracy and macro F1. Accuracy is simply the proportion of true results among the total
number of cases examined. While accuracy is a poor measure when using imbalanced datasets, it
works well for balanced and binary classiﬁcation tasks such as this and has the advantage of being
easy to interpret. The Macro F1 Score also takes into account how balanced the model is between
the two classes, capturing whether the model is biased toward responding one party over the other.
Macro F1 is the average of the individual F1 scores for the two classes and is more appropriate for
binary classiﬁcation tasks as it ensures that the model’s performance is assessed across both
groups. The Krippendorf’s Alpha inter-coder reliability of the models was also calculated, to
assess the stability of the model in relation to minor differences in the instructions. These results
are provided in SI.2.

In addition to examining their performance, we also examine in detail all cases in which each
model fails, in order to identify the interpretative strengths and weaknesses of the models. We seek
to identify patterns in the cases for which the models fail and follow up the initial labeling with a
request for the LLM to “motivate your response.” Such motivations can be highly useful for
scoping the models’ contextual knowledge—however, some care must be taken regarding their
interpretation, as these motivations should be considered a form of post-hoc rationalizations. (It
should however be noted that psychological research suggests that this is not necessarily different
from how humans motivate their decisions, see e.g., Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). Research fur-
thermore has yet to examine the extent to which the models are consistent with their own
explanations.

Model 1: Zero-Shot GPT
We use OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, version gpt-4-0314, which at the time of writing is among the
most sophisticated LLMs available (Achiam et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023). While it is possible to
ﬁne-tune GPT models for classiﬁcation task, we here seek to examine the zero-shot performance
of the model. GPT-4 was used through the API to classify each message, provided in random
order. When using LLMs, researchers provide a prompt written in plain language which guides the
LLM annotation. The following prompt was used:

1186

Social Science Computer Review 43(6)

“You will be given a set of Twitter posts from different [country] politicians, sent during the two
months preceding the [year] [country] election, that is, between [date], and [date]. Your task is to use
your knowledge of [country] politics to make an educated guess on whether the poster is a [party1] or
[party2]. Respond either ‘[party1]’ or ‘[party2]’. If the message does not have enough information for
an educated guess, just make your best guess.”

The same procedure was used across countries and languages, and the prompt was not

translated.

Model 2: Supervised Na¨ıve Bayes Model
We use a Naive Bayes classiﬁer as a baseline model—a staple in statistical classiﬁcation
techniques. The model operates under the assumption of feature independence given the class
label, which often yields surprisingly robust results in text classiﬁcation (Rish, 2001). Our
implementation utilizes the bag-of-words representation, where documents are described by word
occurrences while disregarding the order of words. This model transforms the text into ﬁxed-
length vectors of word counts, providing a straightforward yet effective approach to capture the
textual information (Manning, 2009). The frequency of each word in the text serves as a feature for
the Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer, which then applies Bayes’ theorem to predict the probability of a
document belonging to a particular class. The simplicity of the Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer, combined
with the high-dimensional feature space generated by the bag-of-words model, makes it a
particularly attractive choice for large-scale text classiﬁcation, offering a balance between
computational efﬁciency and predictive performance (McCallum & Nigam, 1998). While the
model is relatively simple, it is commonly used and relatively powerful, thus offering a useful
baseline. The model was used via the scikit-learn package in Python (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

Model 3: Fine-Tuned BERT Model
We furthermore use a ﬁne-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans-
formers) model. This is a state-of-the-art conventional supervised model with a deep contextual
understanding and text representation (Devlin et al., 2019). Unlike conventional supervised
models, BERT is pre-trained on a vast corpus of text, allowing it to internalize a broad under-
standing of language before any task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning occurs. BERT furthermore uses the same
Transformer architecture as the GPT model, allowing it to capture the context of words in
sentences. The supervised nature of our BERT implementation ensures that the model’s pre-
dictions are directly inﬂuenced by the labeled data provided, making it capable of complex text
classiﬁcation challenges where nuance and context signiﬁcantly impact the interpretation and
annotation of text (Wang et al., 2019). BERT is here used via the simpletransformers and
transformers packages in Python.

We implemented and ﬁne-tuned a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) model, a state-of-the-art supervised learning model with a deep contextual un-
derstanding of text (Devlin et al., 2019). BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text, which
allows it to internalize broad language patterns and context before undergoing task-speciﬁc ﬁne-
tuning. This ﬁne-tuning adapts the model to the speciﬁc task at hand by adjusting the pre-trained
parameters to better predict labels in the new dataset (Wang et al., 2019).

For our implementation, we used the simpletransformers and transformers packages in Python,
speciﬁcally leveraging the bert-base-uncased model. The ﬁne-tuning process involved training the
model on our dataset using 3 epochs, with a batch size of 16 for training and 64 for evaluation. The
training utilized AdamW as the optimizer, with a warmup period of 500 steps and weight decay of

T¨ornberg

1187

0.01 to prevent overﬁtting. The training process was accelerated by leveraging GPU hardware
acceleration using MPS. The dataset was tokenized using the BERT tokenizer with truncation and
padding to ensure that all inputs had a uniform length. We created a custom dataset class in
PyTorch to handle the tokenized inputs and corresponding labels. Fine-tuning was carried out
using the Trainer class from the transformers library, which handled the optimization and gradient
updates. Given the relatively small size of our dataset, the ﬁne-tuning process took approximately
3 hours on the provided hardware. Fine-tuning BERT allowed the model to leverage its pre-trained
knowledge while adapting to the nuances of our speciﬁc text classiﬁcation task, making it suitable
for more complex tasks where context plays a critical role in interpreting and annotating text.

Model 4: MTurk Crowd Workers
On the US case, we also compare to online crowd workers, using MTurk—an online platform for
click-labor, which makes it easy to recruit a large number of workers. MTurk classiﬁcation
however varies signiﬁcantly in quality depending on the details of how the tasks are implemented,
making it perilous to compare models with MTurk accuracy without additional veriﬁcation
(Chmielewski & Kucker, 2020). To maximize accuracy of the MTurk predictions, best practices
were thus used to ensure high quality responses: only Master Qualiﬁed workers (a special group of
elite MTurk workers whose abilities have been veriﬁed) residing in the United States were allowed
to respond. (Note that MTurk was run in early March 2023, before use of LLMs among crowd
workers was widespread). The workers were given the questions in batches of 50, each with 4
control questions in which the author’s political afﬁliation was evident (e.g., “If one thing is
certain, I am a Democrat!”). If the worker failed any of these questions, all their responses were
automatically rejected. Each question was answered by 10 independent crowd workers. Statistical
signiﬁcance was assessed using Wilson’s method for calculating the conﬁdence interval around
the accuracy score, providing both lower and upper bounds for the conﬁdence level. We show both
the average performance of the workers and the performance of the plurality answer—which tends
to be signiﬁcantly higher due to the “wisdom of crowd” effect.

Model 5: Expert Coders

On the US case, we also have three researchers with PhDs in political science or related disciplines
classify all messages. These experts were given the 500 messages in random order and the same
instructions as GPT. The purpose of using these expert coders was to offer a reasonable upper limit
to the performance of human coders on the annotation task, as these scholars have deep knowledge
and contextual understanding of politics. The use of human experts is also common for smaller
coding tasks in the social sciences. The performance of the experts is likely higher than would be
expected for realistic annotation projects, as the labeling material was relatively small, and the
human coders were hence unlikely to lapse in attention through the process. For the human
experts, we compare with both the individual performance and the majority vote (Table 1).

Results

We begin focusing on the US case, for which we have comparison also with crowd workers and
human experts. Figure 1 presents the accuracy and macro F1 scores across the models and the
human classiﬁers. As the table shows, GPT-4 has the highest accuracy and macro F1 score of all
models.

As the table shows, GPT-4 has the by far highest accuracy of all models. The model in other
words has the highest proportion of correct results out of all the cases. It also has the highest macro

F1 score, indicating that the response does not show a strong bias toward either class. This can also
be seen in the balance score, which suggests that it deviates from the equal guessing only by a few
percentages. As the ﬁgure shows, GPT-4 is statistically signiﬁcantly better than all other models
with 95% conﬁdence.

As expected, the Na¨ıve Bayes has the worst performance of all models—but still achieves a
respectable 79.2% accuracy, suggesting that there is quite strong association between words used
and party belonging in the US context. As also expected, the expert plurality has the second
highest accuracy, with 86%, but is closely matched by MTurk plurality. The supervised BERT
model performs better than the average crowd worker but slightly worse than the average expert
coder.

The model results were found to be stable to variations in the instructions (see Figure SI.2).

T¨ornberg

1189

We next turn to examining the models’ performance across countries. We here focus on the
accuracy measure, as it is a valid measure for balanced binary classiﬁcation and easier to interpret
than macro F1. Figure 2 shows the accuracy of GPT-4 and the supervised models across countries.
While the difference between GPT-4 and the supervised models are not signiﬁcant for all
countries, the LLM has highest accuracy for all countries. This is signiﬁcant, as it suggests that the
model achieves high performance across languages and cultural contexts, despite its training data
being dominated by English and the US context.

The reason that all models achieve lower accuracy outside the United States is likely that the
annotation task is inherently more challenging in multi-party systems, as the language used may
be very similar across parties. Sweden, for instance, has the lowest accuracy for all models, which
ﬁts the observation that Swedish politicians on Twitter rarely discuss politics, but rather stick to
personal topics—making party annotation a highly challenging task (van Vliet et al., 2020; van
Vliet et al., 2021).

The reduced accuracy for the LLM across countries does not seem to be fully explained by the
language that is used, as the LLM accuracy is higher for both Turkey and Poland than for the
United Kingdom. While the accuracies of the models are correlated—which is to be expected—
the difference between the supervised model and the LLM varies signiﬁcantly across countries.
For instance, the United Kingdom is the country for which the supervised models perform the
worse, but GPT-4 shows relatively high accuracy. This suggests that the models are operating in
different ways in identifying the parties and hence struggle with different interpretive tasks. This
suggests the need for a more in-depth examination of the tasks for which each model tends to fail.

In-Depth Examination of Model Failures
To examine the speciﬁc weaknesses of each model, we manually examine all cases of failures for
the models. The examination reveals clearly that the models display different patterns of failure.

the United States, but the LLM has the highest accuracy of all classiﬁers across all countries and languages.

The supervised models follow a fundamentally different logic for annotation compared to
human coders, as they are based on identifying words and phrases that are associated with a
particular class. For the Na¨ıve Bayes model, speciﬁcally, the accuracy of the model is directly
linked to how strongly the words used are associated to a certain party. This allows the model to
complete tasks that are exceedingly challenging for human coders, by identifying latent patterns of
language. For instance, the model can ﬁnd that an ostensibly arbitrary word is strongly associated
to one political party or that an obscure user handle that is exclusively mentioned by members of a
particular party. However, the supervised models also fail on tasks that are trivial to human coders.
For instance, both the BERT and the Na¨ıve Bayes models failed on the following messages:

“Wisconsin is on track to run out of ICU beds. @VP Pence held a superspreader event yesterday and
@realDonaldTrump has one tomorrow. This is their response to Wisconsin hospitals ﬁlling up with
#COVID19 patients. ⬇ฏ”

“I required the GOP to show up for a live quorum call—Senate can’t do business without quorum Then
I forced us into closed session to talk face-to-face about this nomination & its impact on America But
the GOP decided to keep forcing this nominee through an illegitimate process.”

These messages are challenging for the supervised models, as they do not contain words or
phrasing that is associated with particular party. They are, however, trivial to link to a particular party if
one is able to engage in even basic reasoning around their meaning: for instance, concluding that it is
unlikely that a Republican would refer to a Trump rally as a “superspreader event.”

While the supervised models fail on such tasks, GPT-4 correctly responds to all identiﬁed cases
of such interpretative tasks: there are no examples of cases where the human coders agree on a
correct answer and the LLM is incorrect. Unlike the supervised models, the LLM thus appears able
to carry out annotation tasks which require drawing inferences based on contextual knowledge.
To explore the potential reasoning underlying the LLM’s responses in relation to this type of
interpretation, we follow up with a request for the LLM to motivate its answer and focus on some
particularly challenging annotation tasks. For instance, we can take the task of parsing implicit
references to contextual information, such as in the message: “A friend, a neighbor, a mom, who
could soon serve on the highest court in the land.” While the supervised BERT model was
incorrect, 7 of the MTurk workers were correct, and GPT correctly responded Republican with the
following motivation:

“This tweet is likely referring to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, which
took place during the speciﬁed time frame. Barrett was nominated by then-President Donald Trump, a
Republican, and her nomination was supported by the Republican party. The positive tone of the tweet
suggests that the poster is in favor of her nomination, which leads me to believe that the poster is a
Republican.”

The LLM also correctly interprets messages that require making inferences based on the
assumptions of the aims and intentions of the poster. As an example, we can take a message
containing a Bible quote: “good indeed is the LORD, His mercy endures forever, his faithfulness
lasts through every generation. Psalms 100:5.” The LLM and 9 out of 10 MTurk workers correctly
guessed that the author was Republican:

“[…]While both Democrats and Republicans can be religious, Republicans are generally more likely
to emphasize their religious beliefs and values in public statements, as they tend to have a stronger
connection with conservative Christian voters.”

T¨ornberg

1191

Finally, there are several examples of the LLM outperforming both MTurkers and experts on
tasks involving subjective and contextual interpretation—seemingly as the LLM simply does a
better job of scoping the motivations of the poster and making valid inductions. One example is
the message:

“Down Syndrome Awareness Month helps raise awareness for what it means to have Down syndrome
and how individuals with Down syndrome play a vital role in our lives and communities.”

2/3 experts and 8/10 MTurkers incorrectly guessed that this was written by a Democrat, likely
due to Democrats being associated to support of the rights of minorities and disenfranchised
groups. The LLM, however, correctly classiﬁed the user as Republican, motivating its response by
suggesting that the support for individuals with Down syndrome is a coded expression of anti-
abortion positions:

“[…] Republicans often emphasize the importance of raising awareness for individuals with dis-
abilities, such as Down syndrome, and their contributions to society. This is sometimes connected to
their pro-life stance […]”

While the stringency of the reasoning can be questioned and it is not known whether this form
of inference is in fact underlying the responses of the model, or they constitute merely post-hoc
rationalizations of some unknown other process, the reasoning does appear plausible and con-
vincing, and the model’s accuracy for this type of interpretive tasks is undeniable.

The examination of the failures of the models shows that zero-shot LLMs seem to solve its
annotation tasks based on a different logic than conventional supervised models. The models
appear to engage in forms of interpretation that are more akin to how human coders carry out
coding tasks: not by identifying associations between particular phrases and the given category but
by drawing inferences based on the content of a message and contextual knowledge, and
identifying the purpose with which a message was written. This suggests that the models are
capable of coding messages that have been previously outside the scope of computational
methods.

Discussion

This brief paper has assessed LLM-based zero-shot learning text annotation for the task of
identifying political afﬁliations based on social media messages—a deceptively simple task that
requires complex interpretative skills. It found that LLMs outperform both state-of-the-art su-
pervised models and human coders, offering higher accuracy across languages and country
contexts. While the classiﬁer’s accuracy was highest in the United States, it remained higher than
the supervised models across all included countries and languages.

This paper has suggested that the LLMs achieve their high performance by operating according
to a different logic than conventional supervised models. While supervised models identify latent
associations between phrasings and given categories, the LLM appears to perform the annotation
more akin to human coders—through inferences based on contextual understanding. The model
can therefore achieve high accuracy also when the task requires skills that have conventionally
been understood as distinctly human: implicit meanings, subjective interpretation, reasoning on
the basis of contextual knowledge, or making assumptions of the author’s intentions (Moretti,
2013; Ramsay, 2011). This may explain why the literature has made conﬂicting ﬁndings when
comparing LLMs to supervised models: the LLM coding follows a different logic compared to
supervised models and will hence vary in performance depending on the speciﬁc coding task at

hand. The models are hence challenging conventional distinctions within the social sciences:
between qualitative and quantitative studies, and between close and distant reading. LLMs may
even open for new forms of large-scale inductive interpretative research, representing new
methodological terrain on the interstices of the traditionally quantitative and qualitative realms.
These ﬁndings have substantial implications for use of textual data in the social sciences. By
obviating the need for manually annotated training data, LLMs imply signiﬁcantly reduced costs
and complexity of text annotation. Using LLMs is furthermore orders of magnitude faster than
manual coding. As a result, students and early career scholars with limited resources can now
perform sophisticated analyses that would previously have required the funding and resources of a
major research lab. Such growing availability is not to be taken lightly; as Kuhn (1962) argued,
radical scientiﬁc advances stem not so much from accumulated facts and discoveries, as from the
invention of new tools and methodologies that trigger paradigm shifts in scientiﬁc work.

The LLMs are fast and cheap enough to be used to directly annotate reasonably large datasets.
However, while the models are orders of magnitude cheaper than human coders, platform-based
models such as GPT can still imply signiﬁcant costs when directly applied to annotate truly large-
scale data. For such cases, it may be preferable to either use the LLM to annotate the training data
of a conventional supervised model or to employ a locally run LLM.

The capacity of the model to annotate data across countries, regions, and languages furthermore
has important implications for comparative research. Coding data across cultural contexts and
languages has previously been exceedingly costly and challenging, as conventional supervised
models require separate training data for each context (Raffel et al., 2020). By making cross-
context annotation easily accessible, LLMs open the door for new forms of comparative studies,
with substantial implications for social scientiﬁc research.

At the same time, LLMs also raise both practical and epistemological challenges. When using
platform-based services such as ChatGPT, in particular, there are important implications to
consider for ethics, legality, and reproducibility. For instance, GDPR compliance requires signing
a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with the service provider, for example,, OpenAI. When
dealing with proprietary, secret, conﬁdential, or personal data, it can hence be advisable to use a
model hosted on your own infrastructure rather than relying on cloud-based APIs (Ollion et al.,
2024). While using stable versions of the models provided by platforms such as OpenAI offers
some guarantee of future reproducibility, hosting the model yourself gives full control over the
model version. It also allows the use of models that are more open in terms of their code, training
data, model weights, licensing, and documentation (Liesenfeld et al., 2023). However, as always,
any approach comes with its own upsides and downsides, and the model used must be chosen and
motivated based on the characteristics of the project at hand.

Large Language Models (LLMs) also imply epistemic challenges to how we think about
computational methods. Some scholars have argued that LLMs are inherently black-boxed,
subjective, unreliable, prone to misunderstandings (Kristensen-McLachlan et al., 2023; Ollion
et al., 2024), and potentially biased, as they embody and reproduce the prejudices of the texts on
which they are trained (Lucy & Bamman, 2021). However, many of the same criticisms can also
be leveraged against human coders—who, after all, are similarly black-boxed and subjective. The
social sciences have met the limitations of human coders by establishing standards and best
practices for text annotation, developing systematic coding procedures that seek to mitigate
subjectivity and bias, while ensuring reliability. Importantly, validation remains crucial when
using LLMs: while training the model on large sets of manually coded data may no longer be
necessary, careful validation of the model’s performance on speciﬁc tasks remains essential
(Grimmer & Stewart, 2013). Using LLMs through their interface is furthermore not generally
recommended: the data are often used for model training, the interfaces offer limited control over
the model version used, and the interfaces include system prompts which reduce reproducibility.

While LLMs are offering an exciting opportunity for powerful new forms of research, it is vital
that the ﬁeld develops standards and best practices for reliable, reproducible, and ethical use of
LLMs in social scientiﬁc research (T¨ornberg, 2024b).

Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to represent a qualitative shift in computational text
analysis, achieving their annotation accuracy by drawing on capacities that appear akin to human
interpretation. While such capacities do not necessarily supplant the role of interpretation in the
social sciences, they do challenge the existing divide between quantitative and qualitative ap-
proaches. LLMs appear to have granted machines access to the realm of ideas, values, and beliefs
about the world within which texts are culturally and socially situated—historically thought to be
an exclusively human domain. In concrete terms, this means that powerful large-scale textual
analysis is now available to nearly any scholar, suggesting an impending paradigm shift in text-as-
data. Interpretation is inherently subjective and contested, and the models bring to the surface
challenging questions of meaning, nuance, and ambiguity. More broadly, it urges us to not only
examine the technical capabilities of these models but also to confront the deeper epistemological
and meta-theoretical questions about the nature and role of interpretation in the social sciences,
and to employ the models to explore the borderlands between conventional qualitative and
quantitative approaches.

While this paper offers important evidence on the capacities of LLMs for zero-shot text
annotation, some limitations should be mentioned. First, the task employed may be differently
challenging across countries, due to, for instance, political differences. While the comparison
between supervised and zero-shot models across regions is insightful, further research is needed to
compare the capacity of the LLM across country contexts. Second, the capacity of the model on
the speciﬁc task employed may not generalize to other text annotation tasks. Additional research is
needed to scope the strengths and limitations of LLMs across diverse text annotation tasks.
