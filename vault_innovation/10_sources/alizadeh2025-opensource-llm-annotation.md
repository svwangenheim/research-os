ABSTRACT
This paper studies the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs)
in text classification tasks typical for political science research. By examining tasks
like stance, topic, and relevance classification, we aim to guide scholars in making
informed decisions about their use of LLMs for text analysis. Specifically, we
conduct an assessment of both zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs across a range of
text annotation tasks using news articles and tweets datasets. Our analysis shows
that fine-tuning improves the performance of open-source LLMs, allowing them to
match or even surpass zero-shot GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, though still lagging behind
fine-tuned GPT-3.5. We further establish that fine-tuning is preferable to few-shot
training with a relatively modest quantity of annotated text. Our findings show that
fine-tuned open-source LLMs can be effectively deployed in a broad spectrum of text
annotation applications. We provide a Python notebook facilitating the application
of LLMs in text annotation for other researchers.

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
1 Introduction
Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have demonstrated substan-
tial potential for text-annotation tasks common to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
political science applications (Ding et al., 2023). Recent research reports impressive performance
metrics for these models. For instance, studies demonstrate that GPT-3.5 exceeds the performance
of crowd-workers in tasks encompassing relevance, stance, sentiment, topic identification, and frame
detection (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023), that it outperforms trained annotators in detecting the
political party affiliations of Twitter users (Törnberg, 2023 a), and that it achieves accuracy scores
over 0.6 for tasks such as stance, sentiment, hate speech detection, and bot identification (Zhu et al.,
2023). Notably, GPT-3.5 also demonstrates the ability to correctly classify more than 70% of news
as either true or false (Hoes, Altay and Bermeo, 2023), which suggests that LLMs might potentially
be used to assist content moderation processes.
While the performance of LLMs for text annotation is promising, several aspects remain unclear and
require further research. Before proceeding to classify documents, the researcher must: (1) choose
whether directly use a LLM without any additional training (zero-shot) or to manually annotate
some data and follow a few-shot or fine-tuning approach, (2) decide how many instances of data to
annotate for few-shot or fine-tuning, (3) choose between GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and open-source LLMs
such as LLaMA and FLAN. In the sections below, we offer empirical evidence demonstrating the
significance of these decisions in practical terms and provide recommendations on how to best
make their decisions. Throughout, our goal is to highlight the capabilities of open-source LLMs
and fine-tuning approach, and provide a practical guide for researchers.
Zero-Shot Learning enables models to generalize to hitherto unseen tasks without the requirement
for labeled examples, while Few-Shot Learning leverages a minimal set of annotated instances to
adapt the model to new tasks. Despite their applicability, the conditions under which one paradigm
outperforms the other remain an open question. On the other hand, fine-tuning constitutes the
retraining of LLMs on a specialized, domain-specific dataset to augment task-specific performance.
This process helps in endowing the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, while also potentially
reducing some of the model biases. However, this may introduce biases present in the fine-
tuning dataset, thereby requiring careful consideration of the data employed for this purpose. The
extent to which Fine-Tuning and Few-Shot Learning methodologies substantively improve model
performance remains indeterminate. Specifically, unresolved issues include the quantity of annotated
data requisite for significant performance gains in the Fine-Tuning process, and whether Few-Shot
Learning yields statistically meaningful improvements.
Moreover, the role of open-source LLMs deserves more attention. While models like GPT-3.5 have
democratized the field by offering a more cost-effective alternative to traditionally more expensive
annotation methods involving human annotations, open-source LLMs represent a further step
towards greater accessibility. Beyond cost, the advantages of open-source LLMs include degrees of
transparency and reproducibility that are typically not provided by commercial models. open-source
LLMs can be scrutinized, tailored, and enhanced by a wider user base, fostering a diverse group of
contributors and improving the overall quality and fairness of the models. Furthermore, open-source
LLMs offer significant data protection benefits. They are designed not to share data with third
parties, enhancing security and confidentiality. For these reasons, the academic community is
increasingly advocating for the use of open-source LLMs (Spirling, 2023; Ollion et al., 2024). This

transition would not only broaden researchers’ access to these tools but also promote a more open
and reproducible research culture.
To address these questions, we extend previous research (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023) to
compare the performance of two widely-used open-source LLMs, LLaMA and FLAN, with that of
GPT 3.5 as well as MTurkers, using eleven text annotation tasks distributed across four datasets.
Each model is tested using different settings: varied model sizes for FLAN, and distinct temperature
parameters in both zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches for GPT 3.5, LLaMA-1 (through
HuggingChat), and LLaMA-2. We then compare their accuracy, using agreement with trained
annotators as a metric, against that of MTurk as well as amongst themselves.
2 Related Work
The practice of fine-tuning transformer models for specialized tasks has become a cornerstone in
the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the advent of large language models (LLMs)
like GPT-3.5/4 and Bard (now Gemini), a burgeoning body of research is emerging to evaluate their
performance and utility across various tasks.
LLMs have catalyzed a significant paradigmatic shift in the field of NLP, notably in the area of text
annotation. Their capability to mimic human behavior, understand context, and adapt makes them
effective for data annotation tasks (Yang, Jin, Tang, Han, Feng, Jiang, Yin and Hu, 2023). This
adaptability is primarily conditioned through intricate prompt engineering methods, ranging from
zero-shot to few-shot promoting techniques, thereby focusing on generating accurate outputs (Liu
et al., 2023).
Previous studies have extensively explored the capabilities of LLMs in diverse NLP applications such
as text classification, text alignment, and semantic similarity tasks. (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli,
2023) has shown that GPT-3.5 excels in multiple annotation tasks compared to human annotators.
(Törnberg, 2023 b) further substantiates the efficacy of LLMs in the political arena by demonstrating
that ChatGPT-4 outperforms both expert classifiers and crowd workers in classifying the political
affiliation of Twitter posts, even when requiring reasoning based on contextual knowledge and
author intentions. Promising results in named entity recognition, fact-checking and various text
annotation tasks have also been reported (Frei and Kramer, 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Hoes, Altay
and Bermeo, N.d.). However, the focus has largely been on practical NLP applications, leaving
unexplored the potential in corpus pragmatics and corpus-assisted discourse studies (Yang, Jin,
Tang, Han, Feng, Jiang, Yin and Hu, 2023).
However, it is imperative to acknowledge that the performance of LLMs is highly contingent upon
both the quality of the dataset provided to be annotated and the proficiency of the model itself in this
area (Pangakis, Wolken and Fasching, 2023). Therefore, the ongoing refinement and fine-tuning of
these models are imperative.
In terms of fine-tuning methodologies, various approaches have been developed. Notably, Parameter-
Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) has garnered attention for optimizing LLMs in resource-constrained
settings (Hu et al., 2023). Another method that has received scholarly attention is the ’chain of
thought’ technique, as validated by (Zhang et al., 2023; Wei, Wang, Schuurmans, Bosma, Chi,
Le and Zhou, 2022). The prevailing methodology, however, continues to be the attachment of
task-specific heads to existing architectures, followed by domain-specific training and performance

evaluation (Howard and Ruder, 2018). Moreover, several papers suggest that fine-tuning large
language models can be effective in improving their performance and also reduce their size. Wang,
Wohlwend and Lei (2020) propose a structured pruning approach based on low-rank factorization
and L0 norm regularization, which achieves significant inference speedups while maintaining or
surpassing the performance of unstructured pruning methods. Binz and Schulz (2023) explores
the possibility of turning large language models into cognitive models by fine-tuning them on
psychological experiment data, showing that they can accurately represent human behavior and
outperform traditional cognitive models in decision-making tasks.
The ascendancy of proprietary LLMs has engendered a series of ethical and practical concerns, par-
ticularly pertaining to cost, transparency, and data protection. In contrast, open-source LLMs offer
compelling advantages, including cost-effectiveness, methodological transparency, replicability,
and stringent data protection standards (Liesenfeld, Lopez and Dingemanse, 2023; Spirling, 2023;
Ollion et al., 2024).
Given the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM applications in text annotation and the critical role of
prompt engineering in their performance, our work aims to evaluate the efficiency of fine-tuned
open-source LLMs across a broader range of text annotation tasks. We also offer a side-by-side
performance comparison with fine-tuned GPT-3.5.
3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Data
The analysis relies on four distinct datasets. The first dataset consists of 2,978 randomly selected
tweets from a more extensive collection of 2.6 million tweets related to content moderation, spanning
from January 2020 to April 2021. The second dataset comprises 3,006 tweets posted by members
of the US Congress between 2017 and 2022, sampled from a dataset of 20 million tweets. The third
dataset consists of 2,480 newspaper articles on content moderation published from January 2020
to April 2021, drawn from a dataset of 980k articles obtained via LexisNexis. Sample sizes were
determined based on the number of texts required to construct training sets for machine-learning
classifiers. Finally, the fourth dataset replicates the data collection process of the first dataset.
Specifically, it focused on January 2023, comprising a random sample of 1,313 Tweets from a
dataset of 1.3 million tweets.
For the fine-tuning section of the three LLMs, we aim to allocate at least 15 % or more of the dataset
to the evaluation set and the remaining 85 % to the training sets. We structure the training sets
in increments of 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 samples, depending on the dataset’s size. If
the evaluation contains fewer than 100 rows or less than two instances of the minority class (the
least frequent class), we adjust its proportion upwards until these conditions are fulfilled. Beyond
meeting these prerequisites, the evaluation set proportion is incrementally expanded by 5 % as
long as it does not compromise the planned training set sizes. This approach aims to optimize the
evaluation sample size across an array of training set dimensions, thereby enabling a comprehensive
assessment of how varying training data volumes impact the performance of all three LLMs. This
approach also facilitates a comparative analysis using identical datasets for zero-shot learning,
few-shot learning, and fine-tuning.

3.2 Data Annotation Tasks
We implemented several annotation tasks: (1) relevance : whether a tweet is about content modera-
tion or, in a separate task, about politics; (2) topic detection : whether a tweet is about a set of six
pre-defined topics (i.e. Section 230, Trump Ban, Complaint, Platform Policies, Twitter Support,
and others); (3) stance detection : whether a tweet is in favor of, against, or neutral about repealing
Section 230 (a piece of US legislation central to content moderation); (4) general frame detection :
whether a tweet contains a set of two opposing frames (“problem’ and “solution”). The solution
frame describes tweets framing content moderation as a solution to other issues (e.g., hate speech).
The problem frame describes tweets framing content moderation as a problem on its own as well
as to other issues (e.g., free speech); (5) policy frame detection : whether a tweet contains a set of
fourteen policy frames proposed in (Card et al., 2015). The full text of instructions for the five
annotation tasks is presented in Appendix S1. We used the exact same wordings for LLMs and
MTurk.
3.3 Trained Annotators
We trained three political science students to conduct the annotation tasks. For each task, they were
given the same set of instructions described above and detailed in Appendix S1. Importantly, to
minimize inter-coder discrepancies and enhance the robustness of the annotation process, each of
the students operated independently and systematically annotated the dataset task by task, adhering
to a uniform codebook and shared procedural guidelines.

3.4 Crowd-workers
To maintain a consistent comparative framework, we engaged workers from Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) to execute the identical tasks administered to trained human annotators and Large
Language Models (LLMs). These MTurk workers operated under the same instructional guidelines
elaborated in Appendix S1. To ensure the quality and reliability of annotations, we imposed several
restrictions on worker eligibility. Specifically, we limited task access to individuals designated
as "MTurk Masters" by Amazon. Additionally, these workers were required to have a Human
Intelligence Task (HIT) approval rate exceeding 90 % and a minimum of 50 approved HITs.
We further restricted their geographic location to the United States. To mitigate the risk of undue
influence from individual workers on the annotations for a specific task, we instituted a cap, ensuring
that no single worker could contribute annotations to more than 20 % of the tweets allocated to a
given task. Similar to our approach with trained human annotators, each tweet underwent annotation
by two distinct MTurk workers to bolster the integrity and robustness of the collected data.
3.5 LLM Selection and Settings
In our endeavor to evaluate the annotation performance and cost efficiency of various large language
models (LLMs), we selected four distinct LLMs. The first model chosen was OPENAI’s GPT-4,
GPT-3.5 (‘gpt-3.5-turbo’ version), a proprietary, closed-source LLM. Complementing this, we
incorporated Meta’s LLaMA-1 (‘oasst-sft-6-LLaMA-30b’ version) and the more recent LLaMA-2
in two configurations: ‘LLaMA-2 13b’ and ‘LLaMA-2 70b. The selection was rounded off with
FLAN-T5, a model we opted for due to its demonstrated promise in prior research (Chung et al.,
2022; Ziems et al., 2023). For FLAN-T5, available in sizes ranging from 80M to 20B parameters,
we experimented with the L, XL, and XXL variants to explore zero-shot capabilities (see Figure S1
in Appendix). Ultimately, we selected the FLAN-XL model for fine-tuning due to its advantageous
balance of computational resource demands and text processing capabilities. This selection was
driven by the model’s ability to provide a sophisticated understanding and processing of text, which
is essential for optimal annotation performance.
In our Zero-Shot versus Few-Shot analysis, we employed only GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-1 (via Hug-
gingChat) with the temperature set to 0.2. For the fine-tuning phase, we utilized the bare LLaMA-1
model, FLAN-XL, and other selected models, with the temperature set to 0.0. Our earlier findings
informed this decision, where we observed a high level of agreement between runs with a tem-
perature of 0.2, eliminating the need to run each model twice. Adopting a temperature of 0.0 for
fine-tuning ensured the maximum level of output determinism, thereby enabling a more effective
and efficient comparison between zero-shot and fine-tuned model performances.
3.6 Prompt Engineering
For zero-shot tests, we intentionally avoided adding any prompt engineering to ensure comparability
between LLMs and MTurk crowd-workers. After testing several variations, we decided to feed
tweets one by one to GPT-3.5 using the following prompt: “Here’s the tweet I picked, please label
it as [Task Specific Instruction (e.g. ‘one of the topics in the instruction’)].” The corresponding
prompts for each task are reported in Appendix S2. For few-shot tests, we employ Chain-of-
Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei, Wang, Schuurmans, Bosma, Chi, Le and Zhou, 2022), where large
language models (LLMs) are provided with both the question and a step-by-step reasoning answer
6


<!-- page 7 -->

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
as examples. Specifically, following previous research (Kojima et al., 2022), we use GPT-3.5 to
generate two CoT-prompted examples per class per annotation task. More specifically, we supplied
GPT-3.5 with examples annotated by human experts, requesting an annotation and a substantiating
explanation for the given annotation. Should the annotation provided by GPT-3.5 align with our
human-generated labels—which serve as the ground truth—we subsequently incorporated both the
example and GPT-3.5’s explanatory rationale into the prompt architecture for the few-shot learning
experiment. Finally, we redeploy the zero-shot prompts in the fine-tuning phase to facilitate a
comprehensive comparison between zero-shot and fine-tuned model performances.
3.7 LLM Fine-Tuning
Pretraining Large Language Models (LLMs) on extensive corpora enables them to perform compe-
tently across a wide range of tasks with minimal examples, often achieving results that rival those
of fine-tuned transformer models (Brown et al., 2020). Specifically, in contexts where the LLM
has not been sufficiently trained on task-relevant data, supervised fine-tuning can offer advantages.
This involves supplementing the model with an additional dataset of labeled task-specific examples
and selectively updating a subset of its weight parameters (Wei, Bosma, Zhao, Guu, Yu, Lester,
Du, Dai and Le, 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). However, while effective, fine-tuning such extensive
models, particularly those with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, can be computationally
intensive, often requiring large-scale GPU clusters. However, recent advancements have made it
feasible to fine-tune these models on single-GPU systems by employing techniques such as 4-bit or
8-bit quantization and adding lower-rank adapter layers to the original architecture (Dettmers et al.,
2023).
In GPT-3.5, the fine-tuning process bridges the generalized learning acquired from pre-training
and the specialized learning required for domain-specific tasks. OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 architecture
permits fine-tuning via its specialized Application Programming Interface (API), encompassing a
multi-step workflow. Initially, the procedure necessitates the preparation of domain-specific datasets,
generally constituting labeled instances. The transformation of this data involves segregating the
input into three distinct components as mandated by the API. The first segment comprises the
system prompt, articulating the overarching task instruction (e.g., Definition, Steps, Examples,
etc.). Subsequently, the second segment encapsulates the user prompt, laden with domain-specific
data and the instruction that requires labeling. The final segment incorporates the assistant prompt,
directly indicating the target labels. To make sure the uploaded data adheres to the requested format,
OpenAI provides a function to check for compatibility2. .
Acting as a facilitative mechanism, the API enables users to delineate the training configuration,
offering the liberty to customize hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs. Once the
configuration is established and data uploaded, the API initiates the fine-tuning process. The model
parameters are then updated iteratively to minimize the loss on the fine-tuning dataset. However,
the inner workings of the fine-tuning process remain somewhat opaque, limiting interpretability and
potential improvements. Post-fine-tuning, the model is evaluated on a held-out dataset to ascertain
its performance on the target task. The fine-tuned model can then be deployed for the desired
application.

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
We employed a combination of techniques to achieve efficient adaptation for fine-tuning the Open
Source Models. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly reduces the number of trainable
parameters by introducing low-rank matrices into each layer that capture task-specific adjustments
(Hu et al., 2021). Additionally, 4-bit quantization compresses the pre-trained model weights from 32-
bit floating-point numbers to a more memory-efficient 4-bit representation, as described in Dettmers
et al. (2024). This combination allows us to perform supervised fine-tuning on large models like
FLAN-T5-xl (Wei, Bosma, Zhao, Guu, Yu, Lester, Du, Dai and Le, 2022), ‘oasst-sft-6-LLaMA-30b’
and ‘LLaMA-2 13b/70b’ (Köpf et al., 2023) with better efficiency and potentially faster training
times. We selected the xl-version of FLAN due to its enhanced capabilities relative to its smaller
counterparts while keeping the computational demands reasonable. We used adapter layers on the
Query and Value attention blocks in all three cases. As the training sets for each task are small and
all are text classification tasks, we chose r= 16 andα= 32 as hyperparameters for the adapter
layers added. A lower rank was chosen to avoid overfitting to the training set, while the αwas
selected to produce a scaling of 2 and give more weight to the output of the adaptive layers and force
the LLMs to follow the format used in the training set examples. As for the hyperparameters during
training, we chose the default parameters of the Seq2SeqTrainer and SFTTrainer from huggingface
(von Werra et al., 2020).
To fine-tune ‘flan-t5-xl’, we used a single 80GB A100 GPU. The training examples had as input the
zero-shot prompt with the coding or labeling guidelines followed by the text to label, and as output
the letter that identified the label that should be assigned to the text (i.e: in the Relevance task ’A’ for
relevant texts or ’B’ for irrelevant texts). For oasst-LLaMA, two 80GB A100 GPUs were needed to
fine-tune the model. For the trainset examples, we followed the original prompt format used to fine-
tune LLaMA-1 and produce the ‘oasst-sft-6-LLaMA-30b’ model3. In the segment designated for
the prompter section, we reincorporated the zero-shot prompt and the corresponding text requiring
labeling. Conversely, in the assistant section of the prompt, we included the target label to which
the text should be mapped to. For LLaMA-2, we needed three 80GB A100 GPUs for the 70b model
while only using one for the smaller 13b model. Furthermore, we maintained consistency with
previous fine-tuning efforts by adhering to the original prompt format established for the "oasst-sft-
6-LLaMA-30b" model. To optimize training efficiency, the input text for both models (LLaMA-1 &
LLaMA-2) was left-truncated at a maximum of 4096 tokens. This combination of prompt design,
targeted allocation of computational resources, and adherence to established prompting strategies
facilitated effective fine-tuning of the LLaMA models. We trained all three LLMs for three epochs
with a batch size of four. To further improve efficiency, we implemented a technique called gradient
accumulation, where the model weights were only updated after accumulating gradients from every
second batch.
3.8 Evaluation Metrics
We computed average accuracy (i.e. percentage of correct predictions), that is, the number of
correctly classified instances over the total number of cases to be classified, using trained human
annotations as our gold standard and considering only texts that both annotators agreed upon.
Second, in applicable cases, we computed intercoder agreement, measured as the percentage of
instances for which both annotators in a given group report the same class.

<!-- page 9 -->

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
For the internal evaluation of the fine-tuning process, we employed additional metrics to garner
more profound insights into the models’ learning and generalization across classes. Specifically,
we calculated each class’s precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure that the fine-tuning process
was comprehensive and aimed at enhancing performance across all classes. Precision is the ratio
of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives, providing insight into
the models’ ability to identify positive instances accurately. On the other hand, recall is the ratio
of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class, shedding light on
the models’ capability to identify all possible positive instances. The F1-score is the weighted
average of precision and recall, thereby balancing the two metrics, especially in cases where one
may have more significance than the other. Employing these metrics facilitated a robust evaluation,
ensuring that the models were not biased towards the majority class and that the fine-tuning process
effectively enhanced the models’ performance across all classes.
4 Results
All results in this paper extends a previous study which compared GPT-3.5’s zero-shot annotation
performance with that of MTurk (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023). We rely on extended datasets
(n = 9,777), which include tweets and news articles that were collected and annotated manually on
the discourse around content moderation (Alizadeh et al., 2022), as well as a new sample of tweets
posted in 2023 to address the concern that LLMs might be merely reproducing texts that could have
been part of their training data. While the previous study used only GPT-3.5 for text classification,
our analysis conducts the same classifications using GPT-4 as well as two open-source LLMs
(LLaMA and FLAN), using the same codebook that was originally constructed for the research
assistants and MTurkers (see S1).
4.1 Choosing the training approach: Zero-Shot versus Few-Shot
Probably the first decision with respect to using LLMs for text annotation is whether to first manually
annotate a subset of data and use it for few-shot learning or just directly proceed with a LLM in a
zero-shot setting (see (Brown et al., 2020) for more background). Moreover, even if a researcher
decides to have some manually annotated data, then the question is whether to use crowd-workers,
or to recruit expert research assistants. The later question has already been answered in a previous
study (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023), in which the authors showed that GPT-3.5 outperforms
crowd workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance detection, topic modeling,
and frame detection. Across the four datasets and a total of 12 annotation tasks, the zero-shot
accuracy of GPT-3.5 exceeds that of crowd workers by about 25 percentage points on average.
For the purpose of answering the question of whether to go zero-shot or few-shot, before comparing
these approaches, we would like to highlight the necessity of measuring the accuracy of LLMs with
a priori annotated data. In fact, no matter how well GPT-3.5 or other LLMs have been reported to
perform across various datasets and text annotation tasks, whenever a researcher is using a new
dataset or need to implement a new annotation task, it is recommended to measure the accuracy
of LLMs on a small subset of manually annotated data. The size of the test set varies in different
papers (e.g. (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023) and (Ziems et al., 2023)) and its somehow arbitrary.
However, we recommend that a human expert manually annotate at least 100 data points.

(HuggingChat). The x-axis shows the accuracy. The y-axis displays the two models grouped
by the model configuration, including Zero-Shot and Few-Shot. Facets represent distinct tasks
and/or datasets for evaluating model configurations.
To understand whether it is safe for researchers to seamlessly use a LLM for text annotation in
a zero-shot setting or not, here we extend the previous analysis of (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli,
2023) to include few-shot learning. We conduct chain of thought (CoT) prompting (Wei, Wang,
Schuurmans, Bosma, Chi, Le and Zhou, 2022). This few-shot approach involves providing LLMs
with question and step-by-step reasoning answer examples. In addition, we include results obtained
from GPT-4 and HuggingChat (which uses LLaMA-1) as well. We chose HuggingChat due to
its popularity and ease of use. The corresponding prompts are reported in S2. The results are
illustrated in Figure 1. Overall, in Figure 1, we can see that the few-shot results are mixed, with
some tasks slightly benefiting from few-shot learning, some performing lower, and some with no
difference. For GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, we see performance gain for few-shot learning in 6 tasks and
performance reduction in 5 tasks, though it varies across tasks. As for LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat),
we see performance gain for few-shot learning in 4 tasks and performance reduction in 7 tasks.

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
With respect to what explains the mixed performance of few-shot learning across various text
annotation tasks, we could not find any conclusive pattern. For example, let’s consider the number
of classes as the measure for the complexity of the classification tasks. We see that the LLaMA-1
(HuggingChat) and GPT-4 benefited from few-shot learning in majority of more complex tasks,
including topic modeling (6 classes), and framing detection (4 classes). However, GPT-3.5 saw
a performance reduction in these three tasks. On the other hand, for the less complex tasks of
relevance (first two plots from the top left in Figure 1), we see that LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat)
experienced significant performance gain from few-shot learning, but GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 results
are mixed. As another example, exploring different types of datasets (tweets vs. news articles), we
see that all GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and HuggingChat are showing less accuracy for few-shot learning in
the relevance tasks, but in the framing detection task, the results are mixed, with GPT-3.5 benefiting
from few-shot learning and GPT-4 and HuggingChat losing performance from it.
Choosing a Training Approach: Zero- vs. Few-Shot
Advantages:
Zero-Shot: Off-the-shelf usage; no annotation cost; academic benchmarks on performance
gain with few-shot learning are inconclusive.
Few-Shot: Possibility of in-context learning with minimal examples; might lead to perfor-
mance improvement.
Findings: In our tests, few-shot results are mixed, some tasks benefited from it and some lost
performance. No explicit pattern with respect to task complexity, model selection, and data
type.
Advice: Always manually annotate 100-250 data points to measure the accuracy of LLMs,
specailly If working on a new dataset or task. We do not recommend spending much money
and time on few-shot learning.
4.2 Temperature Setting: Higher versus Lower
Another important decision that a researcher should make about using LLMs for text annotation
is about the value of the temperature parameter. Both GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat)
have a temperature parameter which controls the degree of randomness, and thus the creativity,
of the output. A higher temperature will result in more diverse and unexpected responses, while
a lower temperature will result in more conservative and predictable responses. The default
temperature value is 1.0 for GPT-3.5 and 0.9 for HuggingChat. Previous research showed that
a lower temperature value may be preferable for text annotation tasks, as it seems to increase
consistency without decreasing accuracy (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023). Here, we extend the
previous research results by assessing the effect of a lower temperature in LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat).
Similar to (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023), we set the temperature at its default value and 0.2
and compare the outputs with respect to accuracy and intercoder agreement. We conducted two sets
of annotations for each temperature value to compute LLM’s intercoder agreement.
Our results demonstrate that lower temperature settings significantly enhance intercoder agreement,
underscoring the deterministic and repeatable nature of the annotations. For instance, GPT-3.5’s
average intercoder agreement increased from 91.7% to 97.6% when the temperature was reduced
11


<!-- page 12 -->

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
from 1 to 0.2 in the zero-shot setting and from 92.3% to 95.4% in the few-shot setting. Similarly,
for LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat), the agreement surged from 46.7% to 84.8% in the zero-shot and from
47.1% to 83.1% in the few-shot settings when the temperature was lowered from 0.9 to 0.2. These
substantial improvements in intercoder agreement with lower temperatures provide a compelling
case for their use in ensuring more deterministic and reliable LLM annotations. Moreover, our
examination of accuracy values further supports the preference for lower temperature settings.
Notably, the accuracy in the task of ’Stance’ classification on Tweets from 2020-2021 increased
remarkably from 53.7% to 70.7% as the temperature lowered from 0.9 to 0.2. Additionally, in the
’Relevance’ classification for News Articles from 2020-2021, we observed a significant accuracy
boost from 56.6% to 72.3% when the temperature setting was reduced. These examples underscore
that a more deterministic approach, achieved by lowering the temperature, improves consistency
and enhances the overall quality of results in various classification tasks, affirming the efficacy of
employing lower temperature settings for improved LLM performance.

Figure 2: Analyzing the effect of LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat)’s temperature parameter on accuracy
and intercoder agreement in text annotation tasks.
Across the four datasets, we report HuggingChat’s zero-shot performance for two different metrics:
accuracy and intercoder agreement (Figure 2). Accuracy is measured as the percentage of correct
annotations (using our trained annotators as a benchmark), while the intercoder agreement is
computed as the percentage of tweets that were assigned the same label by two different annotators
(research assistant, crowd-workers, or GPT-3.5’s runs). Figure 2 shows that while the accuracy and
intercoder agreement are, on average, lower than those reported for GPT-3.5 in (Gilardi, Alizadeh
and Kubli, 2023), the pattern for the effect of temperature is the same. Across all four datasets and
eleven annotation tasks, decreasing the temperature significantly improved the intercoder agreement
scores without decreasing the accuracy. The only exception is for the relevance task in Tweet
(2020-2021) dataset (first row in the top left plot in Figure 2) which decreasing the temperature to
0.2 increased the intercoder agreement but led to reduction in accuracy. Interestingly, the GPT-3.5
results in 3 shows the same pattern for this particular task and dataset.

Temperature Setting: High vs. Low
Advantages:
Low Temperature: Less randomness; less creative answers; more deterministic output.
High Temperature: More randomness, more creative answers, more variations in outputs.
Findings: Our analyses show that in almost all annotation tasks, lower temperature setting
for GPT-3.5 and HuggingChat increases the intercoder aggreemnt rate without decreasing the
accuracy.
Advice: We recommend setting the temperature parameter at zero (no randomness).
4.3 Model Selection: Proprietary versus Open-Source LLMs
Proprietary closed-source LLMs such as ChatGPT and Bard (Gemini) are more convenient and
safe to use for general audiences due to their heavy fine-tuning to align with human preferences
(Spirling, 2023). Although the training methodology is straightforward and simple, the extensive
computational demands have restricted the creation of LLMs to a select few. That is why none of
the open-source LLMs such as BLOOM, LLaMA-1 and Falcon could made a suitable substitutes for
closed-source LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023). More recently, responding to this demand, LLaMA-2
was introduced, which is a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs at scales up to 70B parameters
(Touvron et al., 2023). LLaMA-2 evaluations showed it outperforms LLaMA-1, Falcon, and MPT
in standard academic benchmarks including commonsense reasoning, world knowledge, reading
comprehension, and math, and performs on par with GPT-3.5 in math and popular aggregated
benchmarks but fall short in Python code writing benchmarks (Touvron et al., 2023).

Text annotation has always been costly. Although previous findings showed that GPT-3.5 outper-
forms Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-workers (MTurker) and costs almost thirty times cheaper
(Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023), it is not free of charge. Hence, it is tempting for researchers to
explore the extent to which open-source LLMs are capable for text annotation tasks. In addition
to cost-effectiveness, open-source LLMs are increasingly recognized for their transparency, repro-
ducibility, and enhanced data protection features (Spirling, 2023; Ollion et al., 2024). However, the
academic benchmarks reported above lack the text annotation tasks, especially that of political text.
To assess how well open-source LLMs perform in text annotation tasks, we compare GPT (3.5 & 4)
results with those of LLaMA (1 & 2) and FLAN (T5 XL). Considering the reported training data
size, scaled-up parameters, and reading comprehension benchmarks, we expect the Llama-2 (70b)
model to perform well on our text annotation tasks.

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
Figure 4 compares the text annotation accuracy of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat),
LLaMA-1 (30b), LLaMA-2 (13b), LLaMA-2 (70b), FLAN-T5 (XL), and MTurkers. Six observa-
tions stand out in this analysis: (1) no LLM outperforms others across all 11 annotation tasks; (2)
only GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 outperform MTurkers in all 11 annotation tasks; (3) among the open-source
LLMs, the best performing one in terms of the number of tasks that it outperforms MTurkers is
LLaMA-2 (70b), with 9 out of 11 annotation tasks that it outperforms the crowd-workers; (4)
among the open-source LLMs, the worst performing one in terms of the number of tasks that it
outperforms MTurkers is LLaMA-2 (13b), with only 6 out of 11 annotation tasks that it outperforms
the crowd-workers; (5) among the open-source LLMs, the best performing one in terms of outper-
forming GPT-3.5 is LLaMA-2 (70b), with 5 out of 11 annotation tasks it outperforms GPT-3.5;
(6) across the 9 annotation tasks that are related to datasets published before 2023, all open-source
LLMs outperform crowd-workers where the number of classes is three and greater. In other words,
when the data falls within an open-source LLM’s cutoff date and the annotation task is not a binary
classification, all open-source LLMs perform better than MTurkers.
Overall, these findings underscore that while open-source LLMs are not consistently the superior
choice, they generally outperform crowd-sourced annotations and are approaching the performance
levels of GPT 3.5. Even an out-of-the-box tool such as HuggingChat, which looks and works
very much like ChatGPT, outperforms Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-workers in 8 out of all
annotation tasks and performs close enough to GPT 3.5 in 6 out of 11 annotation tasks. While
there is no universal answer to the question of what is the best open-source LLM for political text
annotation, and the best performing LLM varies across dataset, task, and model size, our results
show that a collection of open-source LLMs could almost perform on par with GPT-3.5. Therefore,
we recommend to (1) use open-source LLMs for text annotation in social sciences research; and (2)
compare the performance of 2-3 open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA-2 (70b), FLAN-T5 (XL), and
LLaMA-1 (HuggingChat), and pick the best performing one.
Model Selection: GPT-3.5/4 vs. Open-Source LLMs
Advantages:
GPT-3.5/4: Off-the-shelf usage; more convenient and safe to use; heavy fine-tuning to align
with human preferences.
Open-Source LLMs: No cost (GPT-3.5, and especially GPT-4 can become expensive for
researchers without large research budgets); more transparency; ethical way to do research
due to data privacy concerns; more reproducibility.
Findings: Our results show that while open-source LLMs are not consistently the supe-
rior choice, they generally outperform crowd-sourced annotations and are approaching the
performance levels of GPT 3.5 (ChatGPT).
Advice: Use both LLaMA-2 (70b) and HuggingChat if resources allow for running heavy-
size models, and pick the best-performing model. Use HuggingChat (LLaMA-1) if high-
performance computing is not available. Do not use LLaMA-2 (13b).

4.4 Annotation Size: How much annotation is enough for fine-tuning?
In this section, we are interested in testing the effect of fine-tuning on the performance of both
closed- and open-source LLMs. Advanced large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and
LLaMA-2, often demonstrate new capabilities and can learn from context with minimal examples,
enabling them to perform complex tasks (Wei, Wang, Schuurmans, Bosma, Chi, Le and Zhou,
2022; Shen et al., 2024). However, fine-tuning these models is still necessary to unlock their full
potential for creative and specialized tasks, aligning their performance with human preferences
(Yang, Li, Zhang and Zong, 2023; Schick et al., 2024). Here, we would like to answer three
important questions: (1) Would LLM exhibit performance gain in text annotation tasks when they
get fine-tuned with human expert annotated data?; (2) If fine-tuning improves the performance of
LLMs in text annotation accuracy, how big the training data should be?; and (3) Does the effect of
fine-tuning on LLMs’ text annotation accuracy varies between close- and open-source LLMs?
Several factors may influence the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs, including but not limited to 1)
pretraining conditions; and 2) fine-tuning conditions. Pretraining factors include the size of the LLM
and the volume of pretraining data, which are critical in determining the quality of the representation
and knowledge encoded in the pretrained LLMs. On the other hand, fine-tuning conditions such as
the nature of the downstream task, the size of the fine-tuning dataset, and the specific fine-tuning
methodologies employed can significantly impact the extent of knowledge transfer to the targeted
task (Zhang et al., 2024). Prior research has extensively investigated the scaling of LLM pretraining
or training from scratch (Hoffmann et al., 2022) as well as the development of advanced methods
for fine-tuning (He et al., 2021). However, the issue of whether and how the fine-tuning of LLMs
scales with the fine-tuning conditions has been largely overlooked.
In this section, we are interested to explore the effect of LLM selection, LLM size, and the size of
the fine-tuning data on the accuracy of LLMs on our running text annotation text. A recent study,
based on three downstream tasks on translation and summarization, finds that the augmentation of
the LLM model’s size exerts a more substantial influence on fine-tuning compared to increasing the
size of fine-tuning data (Zhang et al., 2024). Furthermore, their results show that the effectiveness
of fine-tuning varies across tasks and datasets, making the selection of the best fine-tuning approach
for a particular downstream task less definitive. Considering these recent findings, we should expect
to see a similar pattern, in which the performance gain from fine-tuning is being dependent on the
text annotation task, model, model size, and the size of fine-tuning data.
Figure 5 compares fine-tuning accuracy across five LLMs (LLaMA-1 (30b), LLaMA-2 (13b),
LLaMA-2 (70b), FLAN-T5 (XL), and GPT 3.5), 11 text annotation tasks, between 4 to 7 different
sizes of fine-tuning data (corresponding F1-scores are reported in Fig S2 in the Appendix). Several
observations stand out in Figure 5. First, with the exception of LLaMA-1 (30b), we see a general
trend in other LLMs, in which the accuracy and F1-score of models improves with the size of
fine-tuning data. Second, one of our salient findings in Figure 5 and Figure S2 centers on the
capabilities of FLAN-T5 XL. Our analysis reveals that, when fine-tuned, FLAN-T5 (XL) matches or
even surpasses the zero-shot accuracy and F1-score of ChatGPT across all tasks and datasets, with a
singular exception. It falls short in classifying the Problem-Solution frames in the 2023 tweets.
The third, and arguably the most compelling, finding in Figure 5 and Fig S2 centers on the
differential rates and magnitudes of improvement observed across models during the fine-tuning
process. ChatGPT demonstrates remarkable performance gains, even when fine-tuned with a

function of the training data size for fine-tuning. The x-axis shows different sizes of training datasets,
ranging from zero-shot (no fine-tuning) to 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 rows used for fine-tuning
the models. The y-axis displays the accuracy of the models in percentages. Facets represent distinct

minimal dataset of just 50 instances. Specifically, it registers an average accuracy increase of 15.7
%, which further escalates to 19.1 % when the training set comprises 100 cases. In a stark contrast,
open-source models such as FLAN-T5 (XL) and LLaMA-1 exhibit a more incremental progression
in performance. Intriguingly, the LLaMA-1 model initially sees a dip in accuracy on certain tasks
but tends to recover and improve as the dataset expands to around 250 instances. By this point, both
FLAN-T5 (XL) and LLaMA-1 come close to matching the zero-shot accuracy levels achieved by
ChatGPT. It is worth noting that the average accuracy gains for FLAN-T5 (XL) stand at 7.7 % and
12.4 % when fine-tuned with 50 and 100 instances, respectively. This underscores the point that
open-source models, too, stand to benefit significantly from fine-tuning.
These findings illuminate the complex dynamics at play in the fine-tuning of LLMs for text
annotation tasks. They highlight the variable performance across different models and tasks, the
rapid yet plateauing gains for commercial models like ChatGPT, and the more gradual but sustained
improvements for open-source models. Next, fine-tuning is particularly helpful when using GPT-3.5
Turbo, even with as little as 50 rows of training data. The results are mixed for open-source models
like FLAN-T5 (XL) and LLaMA-1. FLAN-T5 (XL) generally benefits from fine-tuning, while
LLaMA-1’s performance is inconsistent. However, as shown in Figure 5, increasing the amount of
training data does improve LLaMA-1’s performance over its zero-shot capabilities, just like for all
other models.
17


<!-- page 18 -->

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
In our study, we observed that the cost of fine-tuning commercial models like ChatGPT is quite
reasonable. The total expenditure for fine-tuning all our ChatGPT models was only 311 $, with an
additional 34 $ for the evaluation of these models. Specifically, fine-tuning GPT-3.5 costs merely 1.2
$ for 100 rows across three epochs, with subsequent usage costs being only 16 Cents per 100 rows.
These figures illustrate that even when relying on commercial models, fine-tuning is an economically
viable option, especially when compared to the costs of zero-shot usage. While open-source LLMs
can offer significant cost savings when suitable infrastructure is available, fine-tuning commercial
models like ChatGPT remains an affordable and efficient alternative for those without access to
such resources.
In summary, our empirical findings robustly advocate for fine-tuning as the primary strategy for
enhancing classification accuracy across varying tasks and models. Although zero-shot and few-shot
learning paradigms may offer utility under specific circumstances, fine-tuning emerges as the most
consistently effective approach. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of fine-tuning
is not universally high across all task complexities. Specifically, the availability of substantial,
high-quality training datasets becomes imperative for achieving optimal performance levels for
intricate classification tasks. Despite fine-tuning, it remains possible that the model’s performance
may not meet the thresholds required for specific specialized applications. This is particularly
relevant as more labeled datasets become available, making fine-tuning a practical choice for those
aiming to optimize classification tasks.
Annotation Size: How much annotation is enough for fine-tuning?
Advantages:
50-100 Manual Annotation: Less cost; less time consuming.
250-500 Manual Annotation: Potential for higher performance gain.
Findings: In general, LLMs’ accuracy increases with the size of fine-tuning data. FLAN-T5
(XL) matches or even surpasses GPT-3.5’s zero-shot performance across all tasks and datasets
(except one task). Open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5 differ in the optimal number of required
fine-tuning data.
Advice: Our empirical findings robustly advocate for fine-tuning as the primary strategy for
enhancing classification accuracy. If using GPT-3.5, 50 annotated data points are enough. If
using an open-source LLM, go with 250.
5 Conclusion
Automated classification of short and long text is central to a growing number of research questions
in the social sciences. Previous research advocated for using supervised machine learning methods
over dictionary-based approaches and provided best practices for human annotation of text (Barberá
et al., 2021). However, the emergence of large language models (LLM) and their ability to
outperform crowd-workers in text annotation and yielding acceptable accuracy compared to human
expert evaluation (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023) provide researchers with new opportunities to
skip the crowd-sourcing or even training their own supervised machine learning models for text
classification. Nevertheless, in the rush to take advantage of these opportunities, one can easily
neglect to consider crucial questions and underestimate the implications of certain choices.

Open-Source LLMs for Text Annotation
In this paper, we have tried to walk the researchers through critical decisions they need to make for
using LLMs in text annotation tasks (e.g. relevance, topic detection, and framing detection) and
provided them with some practical advice backed by our empirical results. Our most surprising
finding is the substantial effect of fine-tuning on increasing LLMs text annotation performance.
We demonstrate that open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2, and FLAN represent a
competitive alternative for text annotation tasks, exhibiting performance metrics that generally
exceed those of Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-workers and rival those of GPT 3.5 (ChatGPT).
An important appeal of open-source LLMs is that they offer considerable cost advantages. While
ChatGPT provides substantial cost-efficiency, being about thirty times more affordable per anno-
tation compared to MTurk (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli, 2023), open-source LLMs surpass this
by being freely available. This constitutes a significant improvement in the accessibility of such
models, extending their reach to a broader range of researchers irrespective of financial constraints.
Open-source LLMs present benefits that go beyond cost-efficiency. One key advantage is that
they help reduce reliance on proprietary models operated by for-profit companies, which may
conflict with research ethics and the reproducibility standards (Spirling, 2023; Ollion et al., 2024).
Furthermore, open-source LLMs provide distinct benefits for data protection, as they are designed
in such a way that data do not need to be shared with any third-party entities (Van Dis et al., 2023).
This feature ensures that sensitive information remains secure and confidential because it is not sent
to or stored by an external party. The elimination of data sharing in open-source LLMs provides
an extra layer of protection against potential data breaches or unauthorized access. This feature
becomes especially beneficial in scenarios where sensitive data is involved, such as in the legal or
medical fields, where confidentiality is of utmost importance (Ray, 2023; Paul et al., 2023; Murdoch,
2021), but also in social science research involving data protected under the European Union’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or covered by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).
We conclude with four general pieces of advice for text analysts: (1) manually annotate 250-500
data points and use half for fine-tuning and half for accuracy testing; (2) use fine-tuned open-source
LLMs for text annotation due to their cost-effectiveness, transparency, and reproducibility; (3)
always validate the output of LLMs by human expert evaluation; (4) run LLMs at least twice per
task and report average accuracy and intercoder agreement; and (5) set the temperature of GPT or
LLaMA models at zero or a low value to get higher intercoder agreement without loss in accuracy.
Nonetheless, we emphasize that our results are not generalized to all text annotation tasks and
datasets. Taking vital decisions discussed in this paper, researchers should perform their own testing,
especially when working with different datasets or dealing with new annotation tasks.

S1.1 Dataset 1: Content Moderation Tweets (2020-2021)
S1.1.1 Task 1: Relevance
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content posted by users on
social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and
guidelines.
I will ask you to classify a text as relevant or irrelevant to the content moderation:
A: Text is RELEV ANT if it includes: social media platforms’ content moderation rules and practices,
censorship, governments’ regulation of online content moderation, and/or mild forms of content
moderation like flagging, shadowbanning, or account suspension.
B: Text is IRRELEV ANT if they do not refer to content moderation, as defined above. This would
include, for example, a tweet by Trump that Twitter has labeled his tweet as “disputed”, or a tweet
claiming that something is false.
Now, is the following text relevant or irrelevant to content moderation?

S1.1.2 Task 2: Problem/Solution Frames
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content posted by users on
social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and
guidelines.
I will ask you to classify a text as describing content moderation as a problem, as a solution, or
neither:
A: Text describes content moderation as a PROBLEM if they emphasize negative effects of it, such
as restrictions to free speech, censorship, or the biases that can emerge from decisions regarding
what users are allowed to post.
B: Text describes content moderation as a SOLUTION if they emphasize positive effects of it, such
as protecting users from harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, illegal adult content,
or spam.
C: Text describes content moderation as NEUTRAL if they do not emphasize negative or positive
effects of content moderation. For example if they simply report on the content moderation activity
of social media platforms without linking them to potential advantages or disadvantages for users or
stakeholders.

•ECONOMY: The costs, benefits, or monetary/financial implications of the issue (to an
individual, family, community, or to the economy as a whole).
•Capacity and resources: The lack of or availability of physical, geographical, spatial, human,
and financial resources, or the capacity of existing systems and resources to implement or
carry out policy goals.
•MORALITY: Any perspective—or policy objective or action (including proposed action)that
is compelled by religious doctrine or interpretation, duty, honor, righteousness or any other
sense of ethics or social responsibility.
•FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY: Equality or inequality with which laws, punishment, rewards,
and resources are applied or distributed among individuals or groups. Also the balance
between the rights or interests of one individual or group compared to another individual or

family, in-group, nation, etc. Generally an action or a call to action that can be taken to
protect the welfare of a person, group, nation sometimes from a not yet manifested threat.
•HEALTH AND SAFETY: Health care access and effectiveness, illness, disease, sanitation,
obesity, mental health effects, prevention of or perpetuation of gun violence, infrastructure
and building safety.

S1.1.4 Task 4: Stance Detection
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content posted by users on
social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules
and guidelines. In the context of content moderation, Section 230 is a law in the United States that
protects websites and other online platforms from being held legally responsible for the content
posted by their users. This means that if someone posts something illegal or harmful on a website,
the website itself cannot be sued for allowing it to be posted. However, websites can still choose to
moderate content and remove anything that violates their own policies.
I will ask you to classify a text as in favor of, against, or neutral about Section 230:
A. “In favor of” expresses approval for Section 230 and/or advocates keeping Section 230
B. “Against” expresses disapproval towards Section 230 and/or advocates repealing Section 230
C. “Neutral” discusses Section 230 without expressing approval or disapproval towards it

S2.4 Dataset 4: Content Moderation News Articles (2020-2021)
S2.4.1 Task 1: Relevance
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content posted by users on
social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and
guidelines.
I will ask you to classify a text as relevant or irrelevant to the content moderation:
A: Text is RELEV ANT if it includes: social media platforms’ content moderation rules and practices,
censorship, governments’ regulation of online content moderation, and/or mild forms of content
moderation like flagging, shadowbanning, or account suspension.
B: Text is IRRELEV ANT if they do not refer to content moderation, as defined above. This would
include, for example, a tweet by Trump that Twitter has labeled his tweet as “disputed”, or a tweet
claiming that something is false.
The following texts are some examples of ’RELEV ANT’ or ’IRRELEV ANT’ texts to content

Question: TORONTO - Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Monday said the United States had blocked
the delivery of nearly three million face masks at the American border over the weekend. Ford
said restrictions on shipments at the U.S. border have left the province with just one more week’s
worth of personal protective equipment for health-care workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak
in Ontario. In a statement today, he says Ontario is ramping up its own production of personal
protective equipment, but most of those supplies are weeks away from being in the hands of
front-line health workers. At least 451 health-care workers in Ontario have tested positive for
COVID-19, representing about 10 per cent of all cases in the province. In all, Ontario reported 309
new COVID-19 cases today, including 13 new deaths. There have now been a total of 4,347 cases
in the province, including 1,624 patients who have recovered and 132 deaths. Allies of the United
States are complaining about its "Wild West" tactics in outbidding or blocking shipments to buyers
who have already signed deals for medical equipment. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sidestepped
reporters’ questions about the incident on Monday, saying his government was in productive talks
with the United States and adding: "We expect

to the 29-year-old woman who, in a Facebook post, had criticised the Mamata government for
non-enforcement of lockdown norms. The FIR which relies on FB links contains a statement that the
posts implied the State administration was going soft on the violation of the lockdown at Rajabazar

complacent while dealing with lockdown violations caused by a certain segment of the community.

Answer: The provided text is ’RELEV ANT’ to content moderation. It discusses the Supreme
Court’s criticism of the trend of police summoning individuals from different states over social
media postings. The text mentions the power of police to issue summons and emphasizes that it
should not be used to intimidate or harass individuals. It also refers to a specific case involving
objectionable content posted on Facebook and the implications of the posts regarding the state
administration and lockdown violations. These aspects are related to content moderation rules, the

Question: Facebook and Instagram took down video tributes to George Floyd posted by the Trump
campaign over copyright complaints on Friday, following a similar decision by Twitter - broadening

that included videos narrated by Trump discussing Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. The narration is
played over a series of photographs and videos that appear to have been taken during recent protests

the creator under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and have removed the post," Facebook
Spokesperson Andy Stone told POLITICO in an email, adding, "Organizations that use original art

S2.4.2 Task 2: Problem/Solution Frames
“Content moderation” refers to the practice of screening and monitoring content posted by users on
social media sites to determine if the content should be published or not, based on specific rules and
guidelines.
I will ask you to classify a text as describing content moderation as a problem, as a solution, or
neither:
A: Text describes content moderation as a PROBLEM if they emphasize negative effects of it, such
as restrictions to free speech, censorship, or the biases that can emerge from decisions regarding
what users are allowed to post.
B: Text describes content moderation as a SOLUTION if they emphasize positive effects of it, such
as protecting users from harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, illegal adult content,
or spam.
C: Text describes content moderation as NEUTRAL if they do not emphasize negative or positive
effects of content moderation. For example if they simply report on the content moderation activity
of social media platforms without linking them to potential advantages or disadvantages for users or
stakeholders.
The following texts are some examples of ’PROBLEM’, ’SOLUTION’ or ’NEUTRAL’ texts about
content moderation in the form of question and answer:
Question: Twitter removed a "misleading" tweet downplaying the efficacy of masks posted by a
top coronavirus adviser to President Donald Trump, while U.S. cases surged before the Nov. 3
election, Trend reports citing Reuters. As the Trump administration fends off accusations that its
mixed messaging on wearing masks hampered the fight against the coronavirus, Dr. Scott Atlas
continued to minimize the importance of masks with a Twitter post on Saturday, saying, "Masks
work? NO." Twitter Inc removed the tweet on Sunday, saying it violated its misleading information
policy on COVID-19, which targets statements that have been confirmed to be false or misleading
by subject-matter experts. The White House had no immediate comment on the decision. New
infections have been rising fast in the United States, according to a Reuters analysis, with more
than 69,400 reported on Friday, up from 46,000 a month ago. Total U.S. cases have surpassed 8
million. Trump, who was hospitalized with the disease for three nights in early October, has been
criss-crossing the country in a surge of 11th-hour campaigning as he lags in many public opinion
polls. His rallies draw thousands of supporters in close quarters, with many not wearing masks
despite federal coronavirus guidelines. Despite data showing otherwise, Trump has said
Answer: The provided text can be classified as describing content moderation as a SOLUTION.
It highlights how Twitter removed a tweet that downplayed the efficacy of masks, stating that it
violated their policy on misleading information related to COVID-19. This demonstrates content
moderation as a means to address and mitigate the spread of false or misleading information.
By removing the tweet, Twitter aims to protect users from harmful content and ensure accurate
information is shared regarding public health during the pandemic.

Civil War or a collapse of civilization. But the platform didn’t try to name the group, underscoring
the difficulty of grappling with an amorphous network linked to a string of domestic terror plots
that appears to obfuscate its existence. Among other complications, its internet-savvy members
tend to keep their distance from one another, frequently change their symbols and catch phrases and
mask their intentions with sarcasm. The move by Facebook designates this group as a dangerous
organization similar to the Islamic State group and white supremacists, both of which are already
banned from its service. The social network is not banning all references to "boogaloo" and said
it is only removing groups, accounts and pages when they have a "clear connection to violence
or a credible threat to public safety." The loose movement is named after "Breakin’ 2: Electric
Boogaloo," a 1984 sequel to a movie about breakdancing. "Boogaloo" supporters have shown up at
protests over COVID-19 lockdown orders, carrying rifles and wearing tactical gear over Hawaiian
shirts - themselves a reference to "big luau," a
Answer: Based on the provided text, it can be classified as describing content moderation as a
SOLUTION. The text highlights Facebook’s action of banning an extremist anti-government network
associated with the "boogaloo" movement, which is linked to domestic terror plots. Facebook’s
move is presented as designating the group as a dangerous organization, similar to the Islamic State
group and white supremacists, and removing groups, accounts, and pages with a clear connection
to violence or a credible threat to public safety. This portrays content moderation as a measure to
protect public safety and prevent the spread of extremist content.
Question: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced this week that he would fine social media
companies that ban political candidates. Every outlet from Fox News to MSNBC fired off missives
about the bill. What got lost in the news coverage is that Silicon Valley deplatforms very few
politicians, save shock-jocks like Donald Trump and Laura Loomer (if you want to call her a
politician). The same cannot be said for sex workers. This month, Centro University released a
study estimating that 46 percent of adult influencers reported losing access to Twitter or Instagram
in the last year. The bans put a permanent dent in the stars’ income, with Centro estimating sex
workers lose $260 million a year due to social media bans. You won’t hear DeSantis, Fox News,
Glenn Greenwald, or any other so-called free speech warriors decrying porn stars’ lost incomes,
so let me break down how social media companies are screwing over porn stars (and not screwing
them in a good way!). Silicon Valley titans have revoked my social media access multiple times.

Answer: Based on the provided text, it can be classified as describing content moderation as a
PROBLEM. The text criticizes social media companies for their content moderation practices,
particularly regarding the ban on sex workers and adult influencers. It suggests that these bans have
negative consequences, such as the loss of income for sex workers, and highlights the perceived
lack of concern or attention from politicians and free speech advocates. The text emphasizes
the negative effects of content moderation, including restrictions on speech and the impact on
individuals’ livelihoods, indicating that it views content moderation as a problem.
Question: TALLAHASSEE – Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call for punishing social media sites that

of Naples. Brandes labeled it a "big government bill." "This Senate is currently filled with small
government Republicans who do believe that government shouldn’t be in the lives of businesses,"
Brandes said. He added: "This is the exact opposite of the things that we stand for." But Rodrigues
argued back that the measure doesn’t defy free market principles. The bill (SB 7072) orders social
media companies to publish standards with detailed definitions of when someone would be censored
or blocked, and makes companies subject to as much as $100,000 fines for deplatforming a Florida
candidate. "I’m bringing you good policy supported by your constituents," Rodrigues said. The
measure was approved 10-9 by the Appropriations Committee, its last stop before going to the
Senate floor. A similar measure is ready for a full House vote. State and federal courts have
generally taken a hands-off view involving regulating online platforms. Congress also has not
Answer: Based on the provided text, it can be classified as describing content moderation as a
PROBLEM. The text highlights the debate and disagreement surrounding a proposed bill that aims
to punish social media sites for deplatforming former President Donald Trump. Senator Jeff Brandes
argues against the proposal, labeling it a "big government bill" and stating that it goes against the
principles of small government Republicans. This indicates a negative view of content moderation,
particularly in terms of government intervention and potential restrictions on businesses. While
Senator Ray Rodrigues argues in favor of the bill, the emphasis in the text is on the opposition and
criticism, suggesting a portrayal of content moderation as a problem.

Answer: The provided text does not explicitly discuss content moderation or its effects. It focuses
on a scathing report released by Hindenburg Research that accuses the startup company Nikola of
fraud and making false statements. The text does not emphasize the positive or negative effects of
content moderation, nor does it link the topic to potential advantages or disadvantages. Therefore,
the text can be classified as NEUTRAL regarding the description of content moderation.

ads against the US President. While the text does not explicitly discuss content moderation, it

advantages or disadvantages. Therefore, the text can be classified as NEUTRAL regarding the
